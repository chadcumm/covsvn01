Omnipaque-300 contrast, injection site Left AC.  Automated dose control
was utilized.
 
INDICATION:  dyspnea
 
COMPARISON:  None available.
 
FINDINGS:
The exam is suboptimal for evaluation of small segmental and
subsegmental pulmonary artery filling defects due to suboptimal
contrast bolus timing. However, no large segmental or subsegmental
pulmonary artery filling defects are identified. The main pulmonary
artery is dilated measuring up to 3.2 cm.  No evidence of right
ventricular bowing or juxtahepatic reflux of contrast to suggest overt
right heart strain.
 
Multifocal patchy consolidative ground-glass opacities are identified
throughout bilateral upper, right middle and left lower lobes.  A more
consolidative patchy nodular opacity also involves the left lower lobe
measuring up to 8 mm.  Streaky linear lingular opacities are likely
atelectatic.  No pericardial or pleural effusion.  No endobronchial
lesion.  Atherosclerotic calcifications involve the coronary arteries
and thoracic aorta, otherwise of normal caliber. Several bilateral
hilar lymph nodes are enlarged measuring up to 1.3 cm on short axis.
No threshold enlarged mediastinal or axillary lymphadenopathy.
 
Partial visualization of the upper abdomen demonstrates a gastric band.
Cholecystectomy clips are also present. No concerning osseous finding.
 
IMPRESSION:
Suboptimal exam demonstrating no large segmental or subsegmental
pulmonary emboli.
 
Multifocal bilateral consolidative ground-glass opacities in bilateral
upper lobes, right middle lobe and left lower lobe, consistent with
multifocal pneumonia.  Recommend follow-up to document resolution given
some of the opacities are nodular in appearance.
 
Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy which is presumably reactive.
 
Main pulmonary artery dilation, representing pulmonary artery
hypertension.

PROCEDURE:  The procedure, including risks benefits and alternatives,
was explained in detail to the patient and questions were answered.
Informed written consent was then obtained.  The patient was placed in
the seated position.  Ultrasound was utilized to locate safe access for
a thoracentesis and pertinent images were obtained and saved. The site
was prepped and draped in routine sterile fashion. 1% lidocaine was
utilized for local anesthesia.  Thoracentesis was performed utilizing a
4 - French centesis needle catheter.  The needle was removed and
hemostasis was achieved.  A routine dressing was applied.  A STAT
upright chest radiograph was ordered to evaluate for complication.

INDICATION:  Abscess of right upper eyelid
 
TECHNIQUE:  Routine CT imaging of the orbits was performed prior to and
after administration of IV contrast. Intravenous administration of 80ml
of Omnipaque-300 contrast, injection site Left AC. Automated dose
control was utilized.  Coronal and sagittal reformats were obtained.
Bone and soft tissue algorithms are provided.
 
FINDINGS:
As described on prior CT the paranasal sinuses, there has been prior
right-sided craniotomy for aneurysm clipping.
 
Axial images demonstrate aneurysm clips with a right-sided craniotomy
defect.  There is granulation tissue or mucosal thickening in right
frontal sinus and ethmoid air cells.  Sphenoid sinus and maxillary
sinuses are clear.
 
There does appear to be old infarct in the left posterior temporal and
parietal region with encephalomalacia.  Optic globes, optic nerves as
well as intraconal extraconal structures are symmetric.
 
Following contrast administration, there is no intracranial enhancing
mass.  Optic globes and optic nerves are symmetric with no intraconal
extraconal enhancing mass.  No masses demonstrated in the preseptal
space.
 
Coronal images demonstrate no definite abscess or well-delineated cyst.
Extraocular muscles are symmetric and common structures appear normal.
There is nasal septal deviation to the left.
 
Sagittal images demonstrate no right-sided preseptal abscess.  There is
a punctate area decreased attenuation in the upper eyelid medially
which measures 0.1 cm, too small to characterize.

Exam:  CTA neck with IV contrast and reconstructions.
 
INDICATION: CTA of carotids, s/p R CEA with h/o of  possible occluded L
carotid but with retrograde filling from ECA
 
COMPARISON: None
 
TECHNIQUE: Routine CT ANGIOGRAPHY of the neck was performed following
administration of IV contrast. Intravenous administration of 80 ml of
Omnipaque-300 contrast, injection site right antecubital. 3-D
reformatted images were obtained.  Automated dose control was utilized.
 
FINDINGS:
The lung windows demonstrates emphysematous changes and basilar
atelectasis.  There is no threshold superior mediastinal deep or
superficial cervical chain adenopathy.  Subcutaneous emphysema is noted
along the right soft tissues of the neck in this patient recent
endarterectomy. There is trace fat stranding and fluid consistent with
anticipated postsurgical changes.  There are numerous thyroid nodules,
right greater than left.  Largest measures 1.5 cm in the right lobe,
series 3 image 214.  The parapharyngeal, prevertebral, retropharyngeal,
parotid and masticator spaces are preserved and symmetric bilaterally.
The parotid glands and submandibular glands themselves appear
unremarkable. Within the intracranial compartment, there is no
extra-axial fluid collection or midline shift.  The included orbits
demonstrate previous orbital lens extraction.  The mastoid air cells
and paranasal sinuses are well-aerated.
 
Review of the regional bones demonstrates intervertebral disc space
loss involving the lower cervical spine.  There are osteophytic
changes.  There is mild reversal of the normal cervical lordotic
curvature.
 
The thoracic arch aorta demonstrates no evidence for aneurysm or
dissection.
 
Right:  There is evidence for an aberrant right subclavian artery.
There is mild atherosclerotic plaque involving the proximal portion
without flow-limiting stenosis identified.  The vertebral artery
takeoff is from the common carotid artery and appears widely patent
without flow-limiting stenosis identified.  The common carotid is
widely patent without flow-limiting stenosis appreciated.  The external
carotid artery demonstrates small focal dissection series 3 image 304.
There is intact distal filling of the branches. The internal artery
demonstrates postsurgical changes without flow-limiting stenosis or
significant atherosclerotic plaque appreciated.
 
Left:  The subclavian artery is widely patent without flow-limiting
stenosis.  The vertebral artery takeoff is slightly tortuous but is
widely patent without flow-limiting stenosis appreciated.  The common
carotid artery demonstrates occlusion just after its takeoff.  The
external carotid artery is patent with the bifurcation maintained.  The
internal carotid artery fills likely from the external carotid artery
and thyrocervical trunk collateralization.  The proximal internal
carotid artery appears slightly diminutive.  No focal high-grade
stenosis is identified throughout its course.
 
Within the include intracranial vasculature, the distal vertebral
arteries, included portions of the basilar artery, and intracranial
internal carotid arteries are widely patent without flow-limiting
stenosis identified.
 
IMPRESSION:
Evidence for right carotid endarterectomy with trace fluid and
subcutaneous emphysema within the surgical bed.
 
On the right, evidence for aberrant right subclavian artery in addition
to direct vertebral artery takeoff from the common carotid artery. No
evidence for flow-limiting stenosis involving the common carotid artery
or internal carotid artery.  Small focal dissection involving the
external carotid artery with intact distal filling.
 
On the left, evidence for long segment common carotid artery occlusion.
Filling of the internal carotid artery is maintained from external
carotid artery and thyrocervical trunk collateralization with patent
bifurcation. The internal carotid artery is slightly diminutive
proximally.  There is intact filling throughout its course into the
included intracranial segments.
 
Multiple thyroid nodules, largest measuring up to 1.5 cm.  Consider
dedicated ultrasound for further evaluation as clinically warranted.
 
Additional observations as above.

INDICATION:  M79.604
 
COMPARISON:  Plain film imaging of the lumbar spine dated June 28,
2016, and demonstrating somewhat prominent osteophytic changes.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Axial T2, T1 and sagittal T1, T2, STIR imaging was
performed without IV contrast.
 
FINDINGS:
And the vertebral body heights and disc spaces are well maintained.
There is a degree of disc dehydration throughout.  There are minimal
scattered senescent yellow marrow signal changes and some end plate
spondylitic marrow changes, as well as spondylitic spurs throughout.
The cord terminates normally.  The paraspinous soft tissues are
unremarkable.
6 cm fluid filled structure compatible with a simple cyst in the right
kidney.  Otherwise the retroperitoneal structures appear unremarkable.
 
T12-L1:  There are some spondylitic endplate changes, greater
anteriorly.  No evidence of significant narrowing of the central canal
or the neural foramina.
 
L1-L2:  Disc dehydration.  Degenerative spondylitic spurs, greater
anterior.  Mild degenerative changes in the facets with mild facet
hypertrophy.  No significant narrowing of the central canal.  Mild
narrowing of the left neural foramen.
 
L2-L3:  Disc dehydration.  There are some spondylitic endplate spurs.
Minimal degenerative changes in the facets.  No significant narrowing
of the central canal or the right neural foramen.  Mild narrowing of
the left neural foramen.
 
L3-L4:  Disc dehydration.  Spondylitic spurs.  Greater anterior.  Mild
degenerative changes in the facets with mild facet hypertrophy.  No
significant narrowing of the central canal.  Mild narrowing of the
inferior recesses.
 
L4-L5:  Disc dehydration.  Spondylitic endplate changes greater
anterior toward the left, some degenerative changes in the facets with
mild facet hypertrophy.  Mild ligamentum flavum hypertrophy.  Trefoil
appearance of the thecal sac and central canal at this level with AP
dimension approximately 8 mm.  Moderate narrowing of the left neural
foramen and mild to moderate narrowing of the right neural foramen.
Most of the narrowing at this level appears to be due to facet
hypertrophy.
 
L5-S1:  Disc dehydration.  Spondylitic endplate degenerative changes,
greater anteriorly and towards the left.  There are some degenerative
changes in the facets with a degree of facet hypertrophy.  Minimal
concentric disc bulge with small central protrusion of disc material
2-3 mm.  No significant narrowing of the central canal.  Moderate
narrowing of the neural foramina bilaterally.

pseudosubluxation in a patient of this age.  However, ligamentous
injury cannot be excluded in the setting of trauma.  If further
evaluation is warranted, MRI could be considered.

There are numerous thyroid nodules.  Within the upper pole this
measures 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.4 cm and appears hypoechoic and could represent
small colloid cyst. Adjacent to this within the mid pole is a 0.6 x 0.3
x 0.4 cm anechoic thyroid nodule which could represent a small anechoic
cyst. Within the inferior pole is a 1.1 x 0.7 x 0.9 cm nodule which is
predominately anechoic. This also could represent a colloid cyst.
Adjacent to this is an additional 0.6 x 0.3 x 0.5 cm predominately
anechoic thyroid nodule.
 
On the left within the mid pole is a 0.7 x 0.4 x 0.7 cm isoechoic solid
thyroid nodule.  Small anechoic thyroid nodule within the inferior pole
is observed measuring 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.3 cm.
 
Blood flow is normal.
 
IMPRESSION:
Scattered thyroid nodules as described above largest measuring up to
1.1 cm, felt to be similar when compared to previous study.  Many of
these are favored to represent colloid cysts.
