EXAM:  PET CT with FDG INITIAL STUDY
 
INDICATION:  Plasmacytoma involving T12 status post radiation therapy
with compression fracture
 
COMPARISON:  CT chest abdomen and pelvis April 5, 2018
 
TECHNIQUE: Routine PET imaging with CT for attenuation correction
localization purposes was performed from the skull base to the midthigh
level following administration of 11.8 mCI (F18) FDG.  Blood glucose
was 86 at time of injection.
 
FINDINGS:
Head and neck. No suspicious findings to suggest a soft tissue myeloma
deposit.
 
Chest. No suspicious findings. Scattered vascular calcifications.
Chronic mild interstitial lung opacities favoring the lung bases
similar to prior study.
 
Abdomen/pelvis. No suspicious findings scattered vascular
calcifications.  Tiny calcifications in the left kidney may be vascular
or represent nonobstructing stones. No adenopathy. There are colon
diverticula.
 
Bones.
 
There is a 1 cm lytic lesion in the right scapula acromion (series 3
number 46) with SUV max 2.7
 
There is a 8 mm lytic lesion in the left scapular tip with SUV max 3.8.
 
Both of these lesions demonstrate suspicious cortical erosion , and are
suspicious for skeletal myeloma.
 
Interval T11 - L1 posterior stabilization. There is diminished activity
in these vertebral bodies attributed to interval radiation.  The T12
lytic lesion is again demonstrated, complicated by pathologic
compression fracture.  There is low grade linear horizontally oriented
hypermetabolic activity within this vertebral body with SUV max 2.7,
less than hepatic activity and likely related to previous fracture.
 
Background mediastinal activity is SUV max 2.4.
Background hepatic activity is SUV max 3.6.
 
IMPRESSION(S):  Findings suspicious for myeloma with new involvement of
the scapula bilaterally.
Low grade residual activity in the previously radiated and fractured
T12 vertebral body, likely representing post traumatic changes.

Comparison:  None.
 
Findings:
 
Circumferential skin thickening and subcutaneous soft tissue
edema/inflammation are noted.  No focal rim enhancing fluid collection
to suggest abscess.  No sinus tract. Mild low T1 and high T2-weighted
signal intensity as well as enhancement in lateral malleolus. Cyst-like
change and surrounding marrow edema in the anterior calcaneal body near
the angle of Gissane. The marrow signal is otherwise within normal
limits.  No osteoarthritic change.  No osteochondral lesion of the
talar dome.  There is near complete obliteration of fat in the tarsal
sinus.  A small amount of effusion in the tibiotalar and posterior
subtalar joints. Small plantar and posterior calcaneal enthesophytes.
 
Mild intermediate T2-weighted signal intensity in distal Achilles
tendon proximal to distal insertion, compatible with mild
non-insertional Achilles tendinosis. The anterior, medial, and lateral
tendons are normal in morphology and signal intensity.  A small amount
of fluid is noted in the tendon sheaths of peroneus longus and brevis
tendons.  The medial and lateral ankle ligaments are intact.
 
Severe fatty atrophy of the abductor digiti mini muscle.  No muscle
edema.  No extracapsular soft-tissue mass or cystic collection.
 
Impression:
 
Circumferential subcutaneous soft tissue edema/inflammation of the
ankle without evidence of drainable abscess or sinus tract.
 
Mild subcortical marrow edema in the lateral malleolus, reactive marrow
edema versus osteomyelitis.
 
A small amount of joint effusions in the tibiotalar and posterior
subtalar joints, presumably reactive.
 
Mild non-insertional Achilles tendinosis.
 
Mild tenosynovitis of peroneal tendons, likely reactive.
 
Near complete obliteration of fat in the tarsal sinus, suggesting sinus
tarsi syndrome.
 
Small heel spurs.  Severe fatty atrophy abductor digiti mini muscle
suggests a Baxter's neuropathy from entrapment of  inferior calcaneal
nerve.

EXAM:  PET CT with FDG INITIAL STUDY
 
INDICATION:  Small cell lung cancer status post chemotherapy,
evaluation for response
 
COMPARISON:  CT chest July 5, 2018
 
TECHNIQUE: Routine PET imaging with CT for attenuation correction
localization purposes was performed from the skull base to the midthigh
level following administration of 12.9 mCI (F18) FDG.  Blood glucose
was 82 at time of injection.
 
FINDINGS:
Background mediastinal activity is SUV max 1.8.  Background hepatic
activity is SUV max 3.3.
 
Head and neck.  No suspicious findings suggesting metastatic disease.
 
Chest.
 
Left hilar mass has markedly diminished in size, now 13 x 15 mm
(previously greater than 7 cm).  This demonstrates F D G accumulation
with SUV max 7.2. There is a residual right lower paratracheal lymph
node measuring the 7 x 11 mm on series 3 number 90 with SUV max 4.0.
This is an indeterminate finding, however given the resolution of
mediastinal adenopathy elsewhere could be reactive.
 
Focal 1 cm average diameter air space disease in the superior segment
left lower lobe (series 3 number 102) demonstrates S U V-max 3.3. On
previous study there is extensive consolidation is region suggesting
pneumonia.  The small focal residual air space disease is favored to
represent a resolving inflammatory process. The left pleural effusion
has resolved.
 
There is pulmonary emphysema . There is a 4 mm ground-glass nodule in
the right lower lobe on series 3 image 112 which is unchanged. There is
a right-sided Port-A-Cath.
 
Abdomen/pelvis. No suspicious findings.  Left adrenal thickening
without suspicious hypermetabolic activity, likely insignificant.
Gallstones are present. Scattered vascular calcifications.
 
Bones. Lumbar postsurgical changes.  F D G activity in the L3 vertebral
body (S U V-max 5.0) the is likely secondary to previous surgical
changes. There is multilevel grade 1 lumbar listhesis.
 
Impression
There is a residual small hypermetabolic left hilar mass. Negative for
distant metastatic disease.
 
Mediastinal and hilar adenopathy is markedly diminished in size.  There
is a small residual indeterminate right lower paratracheal lymph node
with low grade metabolic activity. There is a subtotal resolution of
left lung air space disease.  Left pleural effusion has resolved
 
There is a 4 mm right lung ground-glass nodule which will require CT
surveillance in 12 months.

Working DX: 
 

EXAM: CT of the lumbar spine without contrast .  Coronal and sagittal
reformats obtained.
INDICATION: Pain in the lower back pain radiates to the right leg
COMPARISON: None available
 
Dose reduction techniques were used including automated exposure
control and/or adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to patient size.
 
FINDINGS:
There are 5 nonrib-bearing lumbar-type vertebral bodies. Lumbar
lordosis is normal. Multilevel degenerative changes characterize by
osteophytosis, intervertebral the space narrowing, and facet arthrosis
most prominent at T12-L1 with remote compression fracture of T1 and 2
mm retropulsion of the superior endplate fracture fragment .  Fusion of
T12-L1 is noted.  No acute fracture. Multilevel Schmorl's nodes. No
acute abnormality in the visualized abdomen and pelvis.
 
At T12-L1, disc bulge along with posterior superior endplate protrusion
minimally narrows the central canal to 11 mm. Mild bilateral neural
foraminal stenosis.
 
At L1-L2, broad-based disc bulge along with posterior osteophytosis
minimally narrow central canal to 11 mm.  This along with facet
arthrosis produces mild bilateral neural foraminal stenosis.
 
At L2-L3, minimal disc bulge without significant central canal
stenosis. Neural foramen are widely patent.
 
At L3-L4, broad-based disc bulge indents and flattens the thecal sac
narrowing the central canal to 7 mm.  This along with facet
arthrosis/hypertrophy produces mild to moderate right and mild left
neural foraminal stenosis.
 
At L4-L5, broad-based disc bulge minimally indents and flattens the
ventral thecal sac without significant central canal stenosis.  Facet
arthrosis produces mild left neural foraminal stenosis.  Right neural
foramina is widely patent.
 
At L5-S1, broad-based disc bulge without significant central canal
stenosis.  Retrolisthesis along with facet arthrosis produces moderate
to severe bilateral foraminal stenosis with close approximation to the
undersurface of the exiting L5 nerve roots.
 
IMPRESSION:
No acute findings.
 
Multilevel degenerative disc disease as discussed above.

Working DX: 
 

Indication:  Right-sided abdominal pain.
 
Exam:  CT abdomen and pelvis without contrast
 
TECHNIQUE:  Multiple axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were
obtained without the administration of IV or oral contrast.  Coronal
and sagittal reformatted images were obtained.  Dose reduction
technique was applied.
 
Comparison:  January 24, 2013
 
Findings:
 
The visualized lung bases are clear.
 
Evaluation of solid organs and hollow viscera is limited due to lack of
IV and oral contrast respectively.  A 1.2 cm cyst in the hepatic
segment 2 (series 2 image 11) is noted.  A few smaller hypodensities in
the left hepatic lobe are too small to further characterize, likely
representing cysts.
Prior cholecystectomy.
The kidneys, adrenals, spleen, and pancreas are unremarkable.
 
The esophagus, stomach, small bowel, large bowel, appendix are within
normal limits.
The bladder and prostate are unremarkable.
No free air, free fluid, or enlarged lymph node.
 
No acute fracture or destructive osseous lesion. Grossly stable
multilevel degenerative changes of the spine most pronounced at L5-S1.
 
Impression:
 
The cause of right-sided abdominal pain is not identified.
 
1.2 cm left hepatic cyst.  A few smaller hypodensity in the left
hepatic lobe are too small to further characterize, likely representing
cysts in the absence of known malignancy.

Working DX: 
 

MRI pelvis/prostate without and with contrast.
 
History:  New diagnosis prostate cancer.
 
Routine multiplanar multi sequence pre and postcontrast images were
obtained.  Diffusion weighted imaging was performed.  20 ml MultiHance
contrast injected intravenously for the postcontrast images were
 
Diffusion weighted imaging is degraded by gradient susceptibility
weighted artifact from hemorrhage in the gland.  This causes signal
artifact.  On MRI this appears metallic, but there is no metallic clips
in the region on the CT from February 25, 2017.
 
No pelvic sidewall adenopathy is seen.
 
Fat-suppressed coronal lava postcontrast images show no adenopathy.
 
Impression:
1.  No definite abnormality seen, with magnetic susceptibility artifact
from the most likely hemosiderin staining from intraparenchymal
bleeding from recent biopsy versus metallic clips, and correlation with
procedure note may be helpful.
2.  Assuming there were no metallic clips placed, repeat scan in the
several weeks may be helpful if significant portion of the of the blood
products have resorbed.
3.  No adenopathy.

Indication:  Dyspnea.
 
Exam:  CT angiogram of the chest
 
TECHNIQUE:  Multiple axial images of the chest were obtained following
the administration of IV contrast per angiogram protocol with coronal
and sagittal MIP reformats. Dose reduction technique was utilized.
 
Comparison: CT angiogram of the abdomen and pelvis with bilateral lower
extremity runoff dated January 23, 2018
 
Findings:
 
Examination is essentially nondiagnostic for evaluation of pulmonary
embolism due to respiratory motion and suboptimal opacification of the
pulmonary arteries.
 
The pulmonary arteries and thoracic aorta are not dilated.  There is no
right heart strain.
 
Scattered bilateral subsegmental atelectasis in the posterior right
upper lobe, lingula, and bilateral lower lobes.  The airways are patent
without endobronchial lesions.  No enlarged intrathoracic lymph nodes.
No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. No pulmonary
nodule or mass. No pericardial effusion.  Myocardium, pericardium, and
cardiac chambers are normal.  No pericardial effusion.
 
The visualized upper abdomen demonstrates small hiatal hernia but
without acute abnormality.
 
No acute fracture or destructive osseous lesion. Bilobed hypodense
lesion along the superior right scapula (series 2 images 111 through
123) is partially visualized measuring approximately 4.7 x 1.9 cm in AP
and transverse dimensions..
 
Impression:
 
Nondiagnostic examination for pulmonary embolism as above.
 
Bilateral dependent subsegmental atelectasis. Otherwise no acute
cardiopulmonary abnormality.
 
Small hiatal hernia.
 
Partially visualized bilobed hypodense lesion along the superior right
scapula may represent a paralabral cyst.  Recommend further evaluation
with dedicated MRI right shoulder.

localization purposes was performed from the skull base to the midthigh
level following administration of 13.2 mCI (F18) FDG.  Blood glucose
was 80 at time of injection.
 
FINDINGS:
Head and neck
No suspicious findings to suggest metastatic disease.
 
Chest:
No suspicious findings.  Scattered vascular calcifications. Benign
pulmonary granulomas calcifications. There is mild apical pleural
scarring symmetric in appearance.  Tiny associated nodule measuring 4
mm each in size are present bilaterally (axial images 68 and 66 of
series 3) .  These are too small for PET characterization, but the
subpleural location suggests reactive intrapulmonary lymph nodes. There
is mild dependent atelectasis bilaterally.
 
Abdomen/pelvis.  No suspicious findings to suggest recurrent or
metastatic disease.  Surgical changes at the GE junction and in the
prostate bed. Mild aortoiliac vascular calcification.
 
Bones. No suspicious findings. Scattered tiny presumed bone islands in
the bony pelvis and left lesser trochanter are unchanged since 2017. In
fact these are unchanged since a CT abdomen and pelvis in January 2015.

organs
 
COMPARISON:  None.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast Low-Dose CT (LDCT) per standard departmental
protocol.
 
FINDINGS:
Lung Screening Specific (Lung-RADS):
Images 127:  An 8 mm sub solid nodular density in the superior segment
of the right lower lobe
Large 5.5 x 4.1 cm mass in the medial right lower lobe abuts
mediastinal fat and likely of the esophagus and posterior pericardium.
Distal to this there are some reticular nodular opacities.
 
Potentially Significant Incidentals (Lung-RADS Category S):
Moderate emphysema
Bibasilar bronchiectasis with mild mucus impaction in the left lower
lobe
 
Other Incidentals:
Left perinephric hematoma/lesion seen on prior CT from 2014 appears to
have decreased in size although is poorly evaluated on this low-dose
scan without contrast.
 
 
IMPRESSION:
 
 5.5 CM RIGHT LOWER LOBE LESION IS HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS FOR NEOPLASM.
Biopsy and/or PET CT scan is recommended.
 
There may be some postobstructive pneumonia in the right lower lobe.
 
Ground-glass density in the superior segment right lower lobe may also
be neoplastic or inflammatory in origin.
 
Bilateral bronchiectasis and lower lobe mucous plugging
 
Severe aortic atherosclerosis with mild diffuse dilatation of the

Exam:  MRI lumbar spine without with contrast
 
TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar multisequence imaging of the lumbar spine was
obtained without and with administration of IV contrast.
 
Comparison:  May 7, 2018
 
Findings:
 
There are five non-rib bearing lumbar vertebra.  The conus terminates
at the level of L1.  The conus and distal spinal cord are normal in
morphology and signal intensity.  Vertebral body heights and anatomic
alignment are preserved.  The marrow signal remains heterogeneous.  No
marrow edema.  Mild disc desiccation at L4-5 and L5-S1 is again noted.
 
Interval bilateral L5 laminectomies and removal of previously noted a
large protruded disc material at L5-S1. Low T1 and high T2-weighted
signal intensity in the operative bed and diffuse enhancement within
and surrounding the operative bed are noted.  No focal rim enhancing
fluid collection to suggest abscess.  Residual broad-based disc bulge
at L5-S1 without significant central canal stenosis or neural foraminal
narrowing.
 
At T12 - L1 through L3-4, no disc bulge, herniation, facet arthrosis,
ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, central canal stenosis, or neural
foraminal narrowing.
 
At L4-5, broad-based disc bulge, mild facet arthrosis, and mild
ligamentum flavum hypertrophy are again noted.  No significant central
canal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing.
 
The abdominal aorta is nonaneurysmal.
 
Impression:
 
Postsurgical change at L5-S1 as described with signal abnormality and
diffuse enhancement in and about the operative bed.  No evidence of
abscess. Residual broad-based disc bulge at L5-S1 without significant
central canal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing.
 
Stable degenerative change at L4-5 without central canal stenosis or
neural foraminal narrowing.

Technique.  Helical acquisition of the cervical soft tissues without IV
contrast.  Subsequently, contrast-enhanced acquisition of the abdomen
and pelvis and chest.  Oral contrast was also provided.
 
All CT scans at this location use dose optimization techniques as
appropriate, including: AEC, iterative reconstruction, and mA or kV
modulation according to size.
 
Findings
Neck.
There is multi station right cervical bulky malignant adenopathy. These
masses are not clearly delineated in the absence of intravenous
contrast.  Largest mass measures 5.5 x 3.5 centimeters in axial
dimension by 3.5 cm in craniocaudad dimension and erodes through the
right lateral mass of the C1 vertebral body.  The vertebral canal at
the C1 level on the right appears compromise.  There is a nondisplaced
pathologic fracture of the right lateral mass of C1 which does not
appear acute. There are numerous additional right cervical lymph nodes
for example 2.8 x 1.9 cm right upper jugular chain node on series 2
image number 58.  3.5 x 1.9 cm right supraclavicular node on series 2
image 37. No left cervical lymph nodes identified, although there is
diminished sensitivity of a noncontrasted examination.
 
There is opacification of the posterior ethmoid sinuses with scattered
additional paranasal sinus mucosal thickening.  There are bilateral
maxillary sinus antrostomies.
 
Chest:
Right-sided Port-A-Cath. 19 x 16 mm left hilar lymph node of the
appears grossly unchanged. 2.6 x 1.9 mm nodule in the anterior segment
left upper lobe previously measured 1.7 x 1.9 cm. Air space disease in
the upper lobes bilaterally is otherwise improved with minimal residual
atelectasis/scarring.
 
There are filling defects in the distal left lower lobe pulmonary
artery and the proximal segmental branches of the left lower lobe
suspicious for pulmonary emboli.
 
The heart size is normal.  There is coronary calcification.
 
There is redemonstration of metastatic lesions at T3 and T6 with mild
height loss (pathologic fractures) at these levels.
 
Abdomen - pelvis:
There is progression of hepatic metastatic disease.  Largest lesion
measures 5 x 5.5 cm in segment four B (previously 2.7 x 2.7 cm.
Metastatic lesions elsewhere in the liver are also enlarged.  The there
are new liver metastatic lesions for example 1 cm mass in the right
hepatic lobe on series eight image 153.  Splenic size is normal.  There
is a 1.6 cm left adrenal mass.  There is worsened upper abdominal
adenopathy for example 3.6 x 2.2 cm portal lymph node which appears
new.  The gallbladder is fluid distended.
 
There is vascular calcification without aortic aneurysm.  The kidneys
are unremarkable.  There is no bowel obstruction or ascites.
 
There is diffuse bony metastatic disease in the abdomen and pelvis,
most notably in the lumbar spine and right hemi sacrum.

MRI lumbar spine without contrast.
 
History:  Low back pain radiating to the left side and left leg pain to
the foot.
 
Routine multiplanar multi sequence MRI images were obtained.  Sagittal
and axial T1 and T2 and central T2 STIR images and coronal T1 images
were obtained.
 
Five non-rib bearing lumbar vertebral bodies are seen.  The conus is
normal in signal ending at the mid to caudal T12 left. With this
counting convention the line drawn between the top of the iliac crests
bilaterally passes through the L4-5 disc space.
 
T9-T10 shows preserved disc height.  Trace Schmorl's nodes along the
superior endplate of T10.  Barely perceptible disc protrusion
centrally.  Ligamentum flavum thickening is seen with mild central
canal stenosis from posterior element disease.  The full extent of the
neural foramen is not included, however foraminal narrowing is no more
than mild.
 
T10-T11 shows complete disc height loss.  Barely perceptible bulge
across the ventral aspect of the central canal.  No focal disc
protrusion seen.  Facet hypertrophic changes are seen with mild
prominence on the right and mild to moderate facet hypertrophy on the
left.  Overall minimal central canal stenosis is seen predominantly
from posterior element disease.
 
T11-T12 shows moderate disc height loss with endplate irregularity
along flanking endplates.  Trace bulge across the ventral aspect of the
central canal from left-to-right.  Caudal foraminal narrowing is
minimal bilaterally.  Facet hypertrophic changes are seen very mild on
the right and moderate on the left with superior articular facet
hypertrophic encroachment into the posterior superior neural foramen on
the left. Foraminal narrowing is moderate on the left.  Foraminal
narrowing is minimal on the right.  Minimal central canal stenosis is
seen.
 
T12-L1 shows at least moderate disc height loss with tiny Schmorl's
nodes.  3 mm retrolisthesis of T12 in relation to L1.  Downward disc
uncovering.  Facet hypertrophic changes are mild on the right and mild
to moderate on the left.  Foraminal narrowing is minimal on the right
and mild to moderate on the left.  Central canal stenosis is minimal.
 
L1-L2 shows moderate disc height loss.  3 mm retrolisthesis of L1 in
relation to L2 with downward disc uncovering.  Facet hypertrophic
changes are moderate bilaterally with some superior articular facet
hypertrophic encroachment into the posterior superior neural foramen on
the left and more so on the right.  Overall moderate right and mild to
moderate left foraminal narrowing is seen.  Central canal stenosis is
mild with both disc prominence and ligamentum flavum thickening in
combination.
 
L2-L3 shows moderate disc height loss with T2 disc darkening signal
change.  Minimal broad bulge across the ventral aspect of the central
canal.  This needs bulky ligamentum flavum thickening from moderate to
severe facet hypertrophic changes bilaterally.  Central canal stenosis
is likely mild to moderate with both anteroposteriorly narrowing and
transverse narrowing of the posterior aspect of the canal from bulky
ligamentum flavum thickening.  Foraminal narrowing is mild on the left
and mild to moderate on the right.
 
L3-L4 shows moderate disc height loss.  Circumferential disc bulge
configuration crowds the caudal neural foramen bilaterally.  Facet
hypertrophic changes are moderate bilaterally with overall moderate
right and mild to moderate left foraminal narrowing.  The transverse
narrowing from posterior element disease forces the posterior epidural
fat pad anteriorly heading to the overall moderate to severe central
canal stenosis.
 
L4-L5 shows 7 mm anterolisthesis of L4 in relation to L5.  Upward disc
uncovering is seen.  Pars defects appear chronic.  There is some marrow
edema in the pedicle and superior articular facet process at L4 on the
left not present on the right.  Central canal stenosis is moderate with
foraminal and extraforaminal protrusion seen on the right superimposed
on the circumferential disc bulge configuration.  This is best seen on
the sagittal T2 comparing the right side on image 10 to the left side
on image 4.  Overall mild left foraminal narrowing and moderate right
foraminal narrowing at this level.  Moderate disc height loss.
 
L5-S1 shows fairly preserved disc signal and disc height.  Disc
protrusion is seen in the right paracentral and foraminal entry zone
position comparing of the abnormal image 10 to the more normal image 5
on the sagittal T2-weighted images.  Facet hypertrophic changes are
minimal, with bulky transverse process at L4 likely providing the added
stability needed to protect the facet joint at L5-S1.
Pseudoarticulation laterally on the right bulkier than left.
 
Sagittal T2 STIR images show trace marrow edema along the undersurface
of T12 typical for modic type 1 changes.  Minimal modic type 1 changes
also seen at the T11-T12 level.
 
Impression:
1.  Multilevel degenerative disc disease and facet arthropathy as
described level by level above at all levels with significant central
canal stenosis L3-4 level.

Procedure Ordered: 13835229~26001~NBD DEXA AXIAL SKELETON~77080~99999701
Admitting DX: C50.411-Malig neoplm of upper-outer quadrant of right female breast
Working DX: 
 

Exam:  NBD DEXA.
 
AP spine and bilateral femur bone mineralization density studies.  A
dual energy x-ray bone density study was conducted with the patient in
the supine position.
 
History:  62.1-year-old menopausal white female with carbonated
beverage use, and history of breast cancer and low back pain.  History
of vitamin D deficiency. Height 69", weight 150 pounds.
 
COMPARISON:  None currently available.
 
FINDINGS:  AP spine L2 - L4.  The measured bone mineral density is
1.443 g/cm2, 120 % of the young adult reference population.
 
The T-score is 2.0 and the Z-score is 3.3.  The current risk of
insufficiency fracture of the lumbar spine is not statistically
increased when compared to young adults based upon the T-score.
 
Total mean dual femur:  The measured bone density is 0.946 g/cm2, 95 %
of the young adult population.  The T-score is -0.5 and the Z-score is
0.5.  The risk of bilateral proximal femur insufficiency fracture is
not statistically increased when compared to young adults based upon
the T-score.
 
Impression:  Based on WHO criteria,
 
1.  Normal bone mineral density of the lumbar spine.
2.  Normal bone mineral density of the bilateral femurs.
 
RECOMMENDATIONS:  All patient's should ensure an adequate intake of
dietary calcium and vitamin D.  Effective therapies for the prevention
of osteoporosis include Bisphosphonates and Evista.  Hormone therapy
may be an option based on review of patient's other risk factors and
benefits of treatment.
 
Please note that the bone mineral density is the single most important
predictor of fracture risk.  Low bone mineral density at one site
predicts increased fracture risk at that site but also at other sites.
Fracture risk approximately doubles for each level that the T-score for
bone mineral density falls below the healthy normal mean.  Other
factors, such as previous fractures, family history, smoking, and age
also independently increased fracture risk.  For example an 80-year-old
has approximately twice the fracture risk as a 70-year-old with the
same bone mineral
density.

Admitting DX: M25.572-Pain in left ankle and joints of left foot
Working DX: 
 

History. Bilateral ankle pain
 
No reference
 
Technique.  Three views of the right ankle and three views of the left
ankle
 
Findings. There is no acute fracture, dislocation or metallic foreign
object.
 
There is flattening of the left talar dome. There is a 4 mm lucency in
the lateral left talar dome suggesting osteochondral defect. There is
sclerosis of the posterior aspect of the left talus. There is joint
space loss and sclerosis about the posterior subtalar joint. Joint
spaces are otherwise preserved about the ankle bilaterally.
 
Impression
Abnormal appearance of the left talus and left talocalcaneal joints.
Findings are likely secondary to remote trauma or a talocalcaneal
coalition. Additionally there is a small osteochondral defect of the
lateral left talar dome. Consider left ankle MRI or CT for further
evaluation.
 
Unremarkable right ankle

Admitting DX: M54.12-Radiculopathy, cervical region
Working DX: 
 

Indication:  Cervical radiculopathy.
 
Exam:  MRI cervical spine without contrast
 
TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1, T2, and STIR and axial GRE imaging of the
cervical spine was obtained.  Patient was unable to finish the exam.
 
Comparison: CT brain dated June 9, 2015
 
Findings:
 
The images are slightly degraded by motion artifact.
 
The visualized posterior fossa, craniocervical junction, and spinal
cord are normal morphology and signal intensity.
 
The marrow signal is within normal limits.  Anatomic alignment and
vertebral body heights are preserved.  Mild disc desiccation and height
loss are noted at multiple levels.
 
At C2-3, no osteophyte disc complex, central canal stenosis, or neural
foraminal narrowing.
 
At C3-4, osteophyte disc complex causes effacement of the anterior
thecal sac and moderate bilateral neural foraminal narrowing.  No
significant central canal stenosis.
 
At C4-5, osteophyte disc complex causes effacement of the anterior
thecal sac, mild left, and moderate right neural foraminal narrowing.
No significant central canal stenosis.
 
At C5-6, osteophyte disc complex causes effacement of the anterior
thecal sac, moderate to severe bilateral neural foraminal narrowing
(left greater than right), and mild central canal stenosis.
 
And C6-7, no osteophyte disc complex, central canal stenosis, or neural
foraminal narrowing.
 
At the C 71, no osteophyte disc complex, central canal stenosis, or
neural foraminal narrowing.
 
The paraspinal soft tissues are unremarkable. Soft tissue prominence in
the nasopharynx with heterogeneous signal intensity (series 2, 3, and 4
images 8-11) is noted. A sub-centimeter high T2 signal intensity focus
in the right submandibular region (series 40 image 11) likely represent
a lymph node. Partial empty sella (normal variant) and left maxillary
sinus mucous retention cyst.
 
Impression:
 
Limited and incomplete examination as above.
 
Mild multilevel degenerative change, most pronounced at the C5-6 with
mild central canal stenosis and moderate to severe bilateral neural
foraminal narrowing.
 
Soft tissue prominence and heterogeneous signal intensity in the
nasopharynx. Recommend direct visualization and further
characterization with contrast enhanced neck CT if indicated.

Admitting DX: ANN SCREEN, M81.0
Working DX: 
 

Exam:  NBD DEXA.
 
AP spine and bilateral femur bone mineralization density studies.  A
dual energy x-ray bone density study was conducted with the patient in
the supine position.
 
History:  66.5 year-old white female with carbonated beverage use and
family history of osteoporosis.  Tobacco use.  Back pain. Height 64",
weight 100 pounds.
 
COMPARISON:  None currently available.
 
FINDINGS:  AP spine L2 - L4.  The measured bone mineral density is
1.247 g/cm2, 104 % of the young adult reference population.
 
The T-score is 0.4 and the Z-score is 1.1.  The current risk of
insufficiency fracture of the lumbar spine is not statistically
increased when compared to young adults based upon the T-score.
 
Total mean dual femur:  The measured bone density is 0.839 g/cm2, 84 %
of the young adult population.  The T-score is -1.3 and the Z-score is
-0.8.  The risk of bilateral proximal femur insufficiency fracture is
moderately increased when compared to young adults based upon the
T-score.
 
Impression:  Based on WHO criteria,
 
1.  Normal bone mineral density of the lumbar spine.
2.  Osteopenia of the bilateral femurs.
 
RECOMMENDATIONS:  All patient's should ensure an adequate intake of
dietary calcium and vitamin D.  Effective therapies for the prevention
of osteoporosis include Bisphosphonates and Evista.  Hormone therapy
may be an option based on review of patient's other risk factors and
benefits of treatment.
 
Please note that the bone mineral density is the single most important
predictor of fracture risk.  Low bone mineral density at one site
predicts increased fracture risk at that site but also at other sites.
Fracture risk approximately doubles for each level that the T-score for
bone mineral density falls below the healthy normal mean.  Other
factors, such as previous fractures, family history, smoking, and age
also independently increased fracture risk.  For example an 80-year-old
has approximately twice the fracture risk as a 70-year-old with the
same bone mineral
density.

Admitting DX: R04.2-Hemoptysis
Working DX: 
 

INDICATION(S):  Hemoptysis.
 
Exam:  CT chest without contrast
 
TECHNIQUE:  Multiple axial images of the chest were obtained without
the administration of IV contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted
images were obtained. Dose reduction technique was applied.
 
Comparison:  CT angiogram of the chest dated October 3, 2018
 
Findings:
 
Evaluation of soft tissues and vasculature is limited due to lack of IV
contrast.
 
Small bilateral pleural effusions and bilateral lower lobe dependent
atelectasis persist.  Previously noted diffuse bilateral patchy
ground-glass opacities have markedly decreased with mild residual
patchy ground-glass opacities in both lungs (right greater than left).
No consolidation or pneumothorax.  No pericardial effusion.  The
airways are patent without endobronchial lesions. Slightly enlarged
mediastinal lymph nodes with the central fatty hilum are grossly
stable.  No enlarged axillary lymph nodes.  The evaluation of hilar
lymph node is limited by the lack of IV contrast.
 
The visualized upper abdomen again demonstrates a 1.5 cm right hepatic
cyst, marked atrophy of the left kidney with a few left renal cysts,
and small prominent retroperitoneal lymph nodes with central fatty
hila. The right kidney is again noted to be absent.
 
No acute fracture or destructive osseous lesion.
 
Impression:
 
Marked improvement of bilateral patchy ground-glass opacities with
persistent small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
No other significant change from prior examination.

Admitting DX: C20-Malignant neoplasm of rectum
Working DX: 
 

Indication:  Rectal cancer.
 
Exam:  CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis with oral and IV contrast.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Multiple axial images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis
were obtained following the administration of IV and oral contrast.
Coronal and sagittal reformats were obtained.  Dose reduction technique
was applied.
 
Comparison: None.
 
Findings:
 
Chest: The airways are patent without endobronchial lesions.  No
pulmonary nodule, mass, focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
pneumothorax.  Linear atelectasis versus scarring in the anterior right
middle lobe.  No filling defects in the central pulmonary arteries.  No
enlarged hilar, mediastinal, or axillary lymph nodes.  The thyroid is
unremarkable.  Myocardium, pericardium, and cardiac chambers are
normal.  No pericardial effusion.  Mild atherosclerotic calcifications
of the left main and LAD coronary arteries.
 
Abdomen and pelvis:
 
The liver, gallbladder, kidneys, right adrenal, spleen, and pancreas
are unremarkable.  A 2.7 x 1.4 cm nodule in the lateral limb of the
left adrenal gland is noted.
 
There is circumferential rectal wall thickening starting at about 7.8
cm proximal to anal verge extending approximately 6 cm proximally with
associated luminal narrowing is most compatible with given history of
rectal cancer. Mild surrounding soft tissue stranding in the mesoretum
raises the concern for extension into the mesorectum. A moderate to
large amount of retained stool is noted throughout the colon.  The
esophagus, stomach, small bowel, appendix are within normal limits.
Oral contrast reached the distal small bowel.  The bladder and prostate
are unremarkable.  Small bilateral fat containing inguinal hernias.  No
free air, free fluid, or enlarged lymph node is seen.
 
Fusiform aneurysmal dilatation of infrarenal abdominal aorta measuring
up to 5.8 x 5.6 cm in AP and transverse dimensions respectively and 9.1
cm in craniocaudal dimension with significant amount of intramural
thrombi is noted.  Fusiform aneurysmal dilatation of the bilateral
common iliac arteries measuring up to 1.8 cm on the right and 1.7 cm on
the left are noted.  The bladder and prostate are unremarkable.
 
Remote bilateral rib fractures and remote mild superior endplate
compression fracture of T12 vertebral body are seen.  Grade 1
anterolisthesis of L3 on L4.  No L3 pars defect.  Multilevel
degenerative changes of the thoracic and lumbar spine, most pronounced
at L2-3, L4-5, and L5-S1.
 
Impression:
 
Circumferential rectal wall thickening with luminal narrowing as
described is most compatible with given history of rectal cancer.  Mild
perirectal soft tissue stranding raises the concern for mesorectal
extension of the cancer. No evidence of metastatic lymphadenopathy.
 
A 2.7 x 1.4 cm left adrenal nodule could be further characterized with
MRI to exclude metastasis.
 
Fusiform aneurysmal dilatation of infrarenal abdominal aorta and
bilateral common iliac arteries.

Working DX: 
 

History. Lumbar intervertebral disc degeneration.  Low back pain.
 
Reference. Lumbar MRI March 5, 2013
 
Technique.  Helical acquisition of the lumbar spine without IV
contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images. All CT scans at
this location use dose optimization techniques as appropriate,
including: AEC, iterative reconstruction, and mA or kV modulation
according to size.
 
Findings
Alignment is normal.  Vertebral body heights are normal.  There is no
acute fracture or subluxation. There is no bony spinal stenosis or bony
neural foraminal compromise.
 
At L5 - S1 there is endplate irregularity and moderate disc height loss.
 
Images are degraded by photon starvation related to body habitus.
Intraspinal soft tissues are poorly evaluated by CT.
 
There is subtle increased density about the left SI joint such that it
is difficult to exclude mild sacroileitis.
 
Impression
L5 - S1 degenerative disc disease.  No lumbar spine bony spinal canal
or neural foraminal compromise
