MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST
 
INDICATION:  Hypertensive crisis, unspecified
 
COMPARISON:  Brain MRI dated 11/02/2017.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar MRI of the brain was performed before and after
the administration of 20 ml Multihance IV contrast.
 
FINDINGS:
There is no evidence of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarct.
 
Global volume loss with associated ventricular dilatation.  Multiple
areas of encephalomalacia are again demonstrated in the cerebral
hemispheres.  There has been evolution of the previously demonstrated
parenchymal hemorrhage in the left posterior temporal lobe.  Additional
scattered nonspecific FLAIR hyperintensities are in the cerebral
hemispheres.  No mass effect or midline shift.  No abnormal extra-axial
fluid collections.  Loss of flow void in the distal right vertebral
artery is similar.  The remainder of the major intracranial flow voids
are grossly maintained.  Hemosiderin staining pertaining to known prior
hemorrhage in the left posterior temporal lobe.  Additional tiny foci
of scattered parenchymal susceptibility artifact are present.  No gross
abnormality of the sella.  The basilar cisterns are patent.
 
After contrast administration, there are no abnormal foci of
parenchymal enhancement.
 
No gross orbital abnormalities.  Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air
cells are clear.
 
IMPRESSION:
No acute infarct.
 
Evolution of previously demonstrated left posterior temporal
parenchymal hemorrhage with hemosiderin staining.
 
Extensive multifocal remote infarcts.
 
Global volume loss with presumed chronic microvascular ischemic changes.
 
Unchanged loss of flow void in the distal right vertebral artery likely
due to slow flow or thrombus.
 
Innumerable punctate foci of susceptibility artifact elsewhere within
the parenchyma which could be due to prior hemorrhages and/or amyloid
angiopathy.

INDICATION: 60-year female patient with abdominal pain
 
TECHNIQUE:  Individualized dose optimization technique was used for
this procedure. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis performed axially
without contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformatted images are provided.
 
COMPARISON:  03/13/2018
 
FINDINGS:The visible lung bases are grossly clear. A 2.7 cm opacity is
present in the lateral right breast soft tissues, stable since the
previous exam. Bilateral pleural effusions are present, greater on the
right. Gallstones are present within the gallbladder. Multiple,
hypodense and poorly defined hepatic lesions are again present
throughout the liver, suspicious for neoplasm/metastases. A few of
these lesions appear more confluent and slightly larger than on the
previous exam, suspicious for progression of disease, however, this is
difficult to confidently assess secondary to large body habitus and
lack of IV contrast. Mild ascites is present. Mild diffuse soft tissue
edema is present. The spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are normal
in appearance.  No hiatal hernia is present.  The abdominal aorta is of
normal caliber. A 2.5 cm hypodense right renal lesion is present along
the mid lateral right kidney which has an average Hounsfield unit of
-10, compatible with a simple cyst which does not require imaging
follow-up at this time. There is limiting artifact present as the
patient's lateral aspects of the body about the CT scanner.  This
limits visibility in the region of the course of the ureters. The
appendix is not identified. Diffuse sclerosis is noted throughout the
bony structures, compatible with diffuse bony metastatic disease. L4-L5
and L5-S1 degenerative disc disease is present.  A scoliotic curvature
of the spine is present.
 
Impression:
1.  Limited exam secondary large patient body habitus and positioning
in the CT scanner, as above.
2. Stable right breast soft tissue density.
3.  Multiple hypodense hepatic lesions appear slightly progressed since
03/13/2018, compatible with slight progression of disease.
4.  Diffuse sclerotic bony lesions are present, compatible with
metastatic disease.
5.  Bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the right.  Mild ascites
and soft tissue edema has developed.
6.  Cholelithiasis.

performed without contrast.  CT arteriogram of the head and neck was
then performed using axial 0.625 mm sections, reformatted in coronal
and sagittal planes.  3D surface and/or MIP rendering performed.  CT
perfusion maps generated.
 
Any cervical carotid luminal stenosis given is relative to distal
normal lumen vessel diameter as per our standard practice (NASCET
criteria). Individualized dose optimization technique was used for the
procedure performed.  150 ml of Visipaque 320 administered
intravenously.

with an acute infarct.  No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.  There
is mild global parenchymal volume loss and proportional expansion of
the ventricular system.  Intracranial atherosclerotic calcifications.
No mass effect or midline shift.
 
CT angiogram of the neck demonstrates  atherosclerotic calcifications
of the thoracic aorta.  The subclavian, imaged axillary, and innominate
arteries appear widely patent.  There are scattered atherosclerotic
calcifications.  The common carotid arteries demonstrate scattered
atherosclerotic vascular disease greatest involving the carotid
bifurcations.  Less than 25% stenosis on the right and 0% stenosis on
the left involving the internal carotid arteries by NASCET criteria.
 
Left vertebral artery is dominant with atherosclerotic calcification
and mild narrowing in the origin and proximal V1 segment.  Right
vertebral artery appears widely patent.  The cervical segments of the
vertebral arteries are widely patent.
 
Intracranially, there is occlusion of a right frontal opercular branch
at the M3/M4 junction corresponding with the acute infarct within the
right frontal lobe.
 
Atherosclerotic calcification involving the petrous, cavernous, and
supraclinoid internal carotid arteries with mild narrowing noted.  The
more proximal middle cerebral arteries appear widely patent.  The
anterior cerebral arteries are patent.  Posterior cerebral arteries are
likewise patent.  Basilar and vertebral arteries are patent with some
atherosclerotic calcification involving the V4 segment left vertebral
artery.
 
CT perfusion demonstrates a small to moderate region of subtly
decreased cerebral blood volume within the right frontal operculum/more
anterior frontal lobe with corresponding increased mean transit time
and decreased cerebral blood flow compatible with a completed infarct.
No definite ischemic penumbra identified.
 
No acute abnormality identified within the neck.  Degenerative changes
of the spine.  Grade 1 anterolisthesis of C3 and C4.  Multilevel disc
space narrowing.  Emphysema within the lung apices. Partially evaluated
left anterior pleural abnormality with area of peripheral soft tissue,
central calcification, and central hypodensity measuring 8.0 x 5.6 cm.
This is incompletely included on this study. Poor dentition with
multiple dental caries and periapical lucencies chest of periodontal
disease.  Multiple missing teeth. Mucosal thickening within the
paranasal sinuses some frothy secretions within the maxillary sinuses
left greater than right.
 
IMPRESSION:
1. Small to moderate-sized acute infarct within the right frontal
operculum/more anterior right frontal lobe.
2. Occlusion of the right distal middle cerebral artery opercular
branch at the M3/M4 junction.
3. Scattered atherosclerosis without evidence of hemodynamically
significant stenosis within the neck or more proximal intracranial
arterial vasculature.
4. CT perfusion demonstrates a small to moderate size infarct within
the right frontal operculum and more anterior right frontal lobe.  No
definite ischemic penumbra.
5. Redemonstrated left upper lobe pulmonary abnormality which is

course along the lesser curve to the fundus then around the greater
curve to the antrum where it terminates near the pylorus.  No free air
is present.
 
ASSESSMENT:
The catheter appears to course around the stomach and terminate in the
pylorus.

UNENHANCED CT OF THE ABDOMEN.
UNENHANCED CT OF THE PELVIS.
 
CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Hematuria. Mantle cell lymphoma.
 
TECHNIQUE:
Helical CT data were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis, from the
lung bases through the pubic symphysis, without administration of
intravenous contrast material.  Data were reconstructed into thin axial
images.  Sagittal and coronal reconstructions were obtained.
Individualized dose-optimization technique was utilized for the
procedure performed.
 
COMPARISON:
Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis obtained March 30, 2018.
 
FINDINGS:
Extensive degenerative changes are present in the lumbar spine, with
multiple irregular endplate Schmorl's node lesions
 
Abdomen:
Limited imaging of the lung bases reveals a focal mixed solid and
lucent or cavitary lesion in the medial basal right lower lobe, 17 x 10
mm on image 9, unchanged.  Cardiomegaly is present with pronounced
right atrial dilation incompletely imaged.
 
Spleen is not enlarged and it has no visible focal lesion.  The
gallbladder contains multiple faceted calculi.  The liver, adrenal
glands, pancreas, and right kidney appear normal; the left kidney,
normal other than a 2 mm nonobstructing central calculus.  A
percutaneous gastric catheter is present; the rest of the unopacified
abdominal GI tract appears normal.  The abdominal aorta has extensive
calcifications without focal aneurysm.  Surgical clips are present in
the central mesentery, with no mesenteric or retroperitoneal
lymphadenopathy.
 
Pelvis:
The prostate gland is mildly enlarged, with transverse dimension 53 mm.
It indents the bladder base.  The bladder contains moderate dense
material consistent with blood products or hematoma.  No focal bladder
lesion is visible (though this blood product material would potentially
obscure a mural lesion).  A small gas bubble likely reflects recent
catheterization or other instrumentation.  The colon has numerous
diverticula, most prominent in the sigmoid segment, without evidence of
diverticulitis.  Much of the rest of its length contains moderate fecal
matter, with no evidence of obstruction.  The appendix is not
identified but there is no right lower quadrant inflammation. No
lymphadenopathy is present and there is no free fluid.
 
ASSESSMENT:
1.  The urinary bladder contains dense material consistent with
hematoma / blood products.  No focal bladder lesion is visible though
this blood product material would potentially obscure a mural lesion.
The prostate gland is mildly enlarged.  The kidneys have no
hydronephrosis.
2. An ovoid mixed density nodule in the right lung base is unchanged
since March 30, 2018.
3.  Cholelithiasis, pronounced right atrial dilation, and other
incidental findings as described.

INDICATION: LEFT ARM WEAKNESS
 
TECHNIQUE:  Axial CT images of the head are obtained without use
intravenous contrast.  Subsequently during bolus initiation of 150 ml
Visipaque intravenous contrast axial CT images of the head neck are
obtained at peak arterial enhancement.  Perfusion data is acquired.
Multiplanar reconstructed images perfusion reconstructions and 3-D MIP
angiogram images are submitted for evaluation. Individualized dose
optimization technique is used procedure performed.
 
COMPARISON:  No relevant recent prior study.
 
FINDINGS:  The noncontrast images of the head demonstrate no evidence
of intracranial hemorrhage, the brain appears appropriate in
morphology.  The ventricular system and sulci appear appropriate.
Gray-white matter differentiation appears maintained.  There is no
evidence of mass effect or midline shift.  The calvarium appears
intact.  The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are
clear.
 
Perfusion imaging demonstrates symmetric perfusion.  No perfusion
defects suggestive of infarct or ischemia are demonstrated.
 
CT images of the head demonstrate the bilateral distal internal carotid
arteries, middle cerebral arteries, intercerebral arteries, posterior
cerebral arteries, basilar artery and distal vertebral arteries to be
patent and without evidence of significant stenosis, aneurysm or
occlusion.  The dural venous sinuses appear patent.
 
CTA images of the neck demonstrate no plaque at the bilateral common
carotid artery bifurcations. The bilateral common carotid arteries,
internal carotid arteries and vertebral arteries appear widely patent.
Partially visualized within the aortic arch there is an irregular
intraluminal filling defect seen within the aorta. Within the
visualized portions I do not see a dissection flap and this possibly
represents a large intraluminal thrombus. This measures approximately
3.5 x 1.2 cm in size. Dependent atelectasis is seen within the lung
apices.
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  No intracranial hemorrhage.
2.  No perfusion evidence of ischemia or infarct.
3.  Intraluminal filling defect within the aortic arch which appears to
represent a large thrombus.
4.  No head or neck arterial significant stenosis, aneurysm or
occlusion noted above.
 
MRI is more sensitive for the detection of acute to subacute infarct.
A negative head CT does not rule out acute infarct.

brachial radial and ulnar arteries.  No color flow is seen within these
arteries.
 
IMPRESSION:
Arterial occlusion of the left axillary artery.  No arterial flow is
able to be identified distal to the distal subclavian artery

INDICATION(S):  Abdominal pain with hematemesis
 
TECHNIQUE:  CT scanning of the abdomen and pelvis was performed without
oral or intravenous contrast.  Individualized dose optimization
technique was utilized for this procedure.
 
FINDING(S):  The liver is normal in appearance without focal pathology.
The patient has undergone a previous cholecystectomy.  The pancreas and
spleen are normal.  The adrenals and kidneys are essentially normal as
well.  The stomach is moderately distended with what appears to be
ingested material.  I do not appreciate gross thickening of the gastric
wall and there is no free intraperitoneal air.
 
Scanning the pelvis reveals no pathological mass lesions or abnormal
fluid collections.  Surgical clips are evident bilaterally in the
pelvis, likely due to a previous tubal ligation procedure.  The
appendix is not well seen.
 
IMPRESSION(S):  Relatively benign-appearing study with evidence of a
previous cholecystectomy as well as a previous tubal ligation.  The
stomach is moderately distended with ingested material and I do not
identify gross thickening of the gastric wall or free intraperitoneal
air.  The duodenum shows no obvious inflammation and there is no free
fluid in the peritoneal cavity.  There is no obvious evidence of
hepatic cirrhosis.  No other abnormalities appreciated.

INDICATION:  47-year female with left-side weakness x1 and a half
hours.  History of brain metastases from breast cancer.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Individualized dose optimization technique was used for
this procedure. Noncontrast axial CT images are obtained from the skull
base to the vertex noncontrast.  Following intravenous administration
of 150s mL Visipaque contrast injected into a PowerPort, thin-section,
contrast-enhanced axial CT images are obtained from the aortic arch to
the vertex with coronal and sagittal reformatted images provided.
Additionally, 3-D rotational reformatted images of the intracranial
arteries and carotid arteries of the neck are obtained.CT perfusion
maps are generated.Per our standard practice, the carotid arteries are
assessed by NASCET technique/criteria, unless otherwise specified.
 
Comparison:  None available.
 
FINDINGS:
CT Head noncontrast:  Multiple areas of scattered hyperdensity, likely
representing calcified or hemorrhage lesions, are present throughout
the bilateral cerebral hemispheres, the largest up to 1.4 cm in the
left parietal-occipital lobe junction. Bilateral subcortical white
matter hypoattenuation is present, greater on the left. A 1-2 mm,
left-to-right midline shift may be present, best appreciated on axial
image 14 at the level of the ventricles and posteriorly. No acute
extraaxial fluid collection is present. The basilar cisterns are
patent. Some of the posterior and inferior left mastoid air cells are
opacified.  The right mastoid air cells are opacified.  The visible
paranasal sinuses are clear.
 
CT perfusion: Elevated mean transit time, decreased cerebral blood
flow, and mixed increased and decreased cerebral blood volume is noted
in the left occipital parietal lobe junction, in the region of the
aforementioned hyperdense lesion. No perfusion abnormality is present
which convincingly suggests an acute ischemic infarct core or penumbra.
 
CTA neck: Normal opacification of the vertebral carotid arteries of the
neck is present without occlusion, significant stenosis, or dissection.
A normal branching pattern of the great vessels off the aortic arch is
present.  The thyroid gland is normal in appearance.  A right chest
port is present with the tip visible as far as the superior vena cava.
Partially - imaged bilateral saline breast implants are present. A
posterior disc osteophyte complex is present at C5-C6 which results in
central canal or neural foraminal narrowing at this level. Mild left
C4-C5 neural foraminal narrowing is present secondary to uncovertebral
joint hypertrophy. A left superior mediastinal lymph node is present up
to 5 mm in greatest short-axis diameter. The right axillary lymph node
up to 4 mm in greatest short-axis diameter is present.
 
CTA head:  There is normal opacification of the bilateral anterior
cerebral arteries, anterior communicating artery, bilateral middle
cerebral arteries, bilateral distal internal carotid arteries,
bilateral distal vertebral arteries, basilar artery, bilateral
posterior cerebral arteries, and bilateral posterior communicating
arteries.  No intracranial aneurysm is identified.  No unusual beading
or dilatation of the intracranial arteries is seen.  No large vessel
occlusion is identified. No vascular malformation is identified.
 
Impression:
1.  Multiple, scattered, hyperdense brain lesions are present with
surrounding subcortical hypoattenuation, compatible with patient's
known metastatic lesions, as per clinical history.  There may be
minimal, left-to-right midline shift present, as above.
2.  Normal CTA of the head and neck without large vessel occlusion or
significant stenosis. No CT perfusion abnormality to suggest an acute
ischemic infarct core or penumbra.
3. Opacified right mastoid air cells.  Partial left mastoid effusion.
4. Degenerative changes of the spine.
 
Impression #1 & #2 were discussed with Dr. Haji on 04/14/2018 at 06:55
p.m.
 
MRI is more sensitive than CT for the detection of acute to subacute
infarction for the detection of small metastatic lesions.

EXAM:  MRI of the lumbar spine without IV contrast
 
INDICATION:  R LE weakness
 
COMPARISON:  Lumbar CT dated 05/29/2017.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar MRI evaluation was performed without IV
contrast.
 
FINDINGS:
 
There are five lumbar vertebral bodies.  Lumbar spine alignment is
normal.  The lumbar vertebral bodies are normal height.  There is mild
STIR hyperintensity in the L4-L5 facets which is probably
degenerative/reactive.  Scattered Schmorl's nodes.  Several
intervertebral discs are desiccated.  The pedicles are congenitally
shortened which contributes to a generalize component of central
stenosis.  The conus terminates at L1.
 
T12-L1:  Disc bulge minimally indents the ventral thecal sac.  The
neural foramen are widely patent.
 
L1-L2:  There is trace disc bulge but the central canal and neural
foramen are widely patent.
 
L2-L3:  There is trace disc bulge and mild facet hypertrophy but the
central canal and neural foramen are widely patent.
 
L3-L4:  Disc bulge minimally indents the ventral thecal sac.  Along
with facet hypertrophy, there is mild bilateral neural foraminal
stenosis.
 
L4-L5:  The left L4 and L5 nerve roots are questionably partially
conjoined.  Disc bulge indents the ventral thecal sac. Along with facet
hypertrophy there is asymmetric crowding of the left L4 and L5 nerve
roots for example on series 4 image 22. Disc material and facet
hypertrophy cause severe left and mild - moderate right neural
foraminal stenosis.
 
L5-S1:  The right L5 and S1 nerve roots are partially conjoined best
seen on series 4 image 14.  Disc bulge does not significantly indent
the ventral thecal sac.  Along with facet hypertrophy there is mild
bilateral neural foraminal stenosis.
 
The visualized proximal exiting sacral nerve roots are grossly
unimpinged. The visualized visceral structures show no gross

CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE CHEST.
 
CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Shortness of breath and elevated D-dimer.
 
TECHNIQUE:
Helical CT data were acquired through the chest, from the thoracic
inlet through the upper abdomen, during pulmonary artery enhancement.
Data were reconstructed into thin axial images.  Sagittal, coronal, and
bilateral coronal oblique reconstructions were obtained.  The patient
received 100 ml Omnipaque-300 without reported adverse event.
Individualized dose-optimization technique was utilized for the
procedure performed.
 
COMPARISON:
Chest CT obtained February 1, 2015.
 
FINDINGS:
Contrast opacification of the pulmonary arteries is excellent.  These
arteries are normal caliber without intraluminal thrombus.  Contrast
opacification of the thoracic aorta is adequate.  There is an aortic
dissection from the isthmus through the renal arteries.  In the
midportion of the descending aorta and the true lumen is larger, but in
the distal descending thoracic aorta and in the imaged abdominal aorta
the true lumen is quite small, anteriorly positioned.  The celiac and
superior mesenteric arteries arise from the true lumen.  Both renal
arteries arise at least mostly from the true lumen though the
dissection flap may enter their ostia.  No periaortic hematoma is
present. A graft site is present in the ascending segment. This
appearance is unchanged compared to February 2015.  Mild cardiomegaly
is present, without pericardial effusion.
 
The central airways are widely patent.  There is patchy ground-glass
opacity and air trapping, but no segmental consolidation or pleural
effusion is present.  There is no interlobular septal edema.  Moderate
peribronchial thickening is present greatest in the perihilar and
infrahilar tissues with a few areas of airway mucus plugging.  Reactive
lymph nodes are present in the mediastinum and hila.
 
Limited imaging of the upper abdomen reveals multiple colonic
diverticula.  The adrenal glands appear normal.  There is a left renal
cyst which is only minimally imaged.  An aortic dissection is present
as described above.
 
Moderate degenerative changes are present in the thoracic spine.
Sternotomy wires appear intact.  No destructive or blastic bone lesion
is present.
 
ASSESSMENT:
1. Chronic aortic dissection unchanged since 2015 with no evidence of
an acute aortic process superimposed.
2.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
3.  Diffuse peribronchial thickening and patchy mucous plugging,
consistent with bronchitis or other reactive-airways process. No focal
pneumonia superimposed.
4.  Mild cardiomegaly is present without pulmonary edema.
5.  Left renal cysts, only very partially imaged, and other incidental
findings as described.

While no definitive evidence for acute ischemia is apparent, acute
ischemic changes can be radiographically occult by CT scan and MRI with
diffusion weighted imaging can be performed if clinically indicated in
further evaluation.

CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Right lower quadrant/pelvic pain, with nausea, vomiting, and fever.
 
TECHNIQUE:
Helical CT data were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis, from the
lung bases through the pubic symphysis, after administration of
intravenous contrast material; additional abdominal delayed data were
acquired.  Data were reconstructed into thin axial images.  Sagittal
and coronal reconstructions were obtained.  The patient received 100 ml
Omnipaque-300 without reported adverse event.  Individualized
dose-optimization technique was utilized for the procedure performed.
 
COMPARISON:
Unenhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis obtained April 13, 2018.
 
FINDINGS:
Moderate to severe disc degenerative change at L5-S1 causes bilateral
foraminal stenoses.  Milder changes are present elsewhere.
 
Abdomen:
Limited imaging of the lung bases reveals no significant pulmonary or
pleural abnormality.
 
The liver is severely steatotic, with no focal lesion; craniocaudal
hepatic span is upper normal at 15.5 cm.  The spleen, pancreas, left
adrenal gland, kidneys, and partially contrast-filled abdominal GI
tract appear normal.  The gallbladder is surgically absent with
unchanged moderate extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation perhaps
reflecting postcholecystectomy remodeling.  The right adrenal gland has
a small dense nodule 21 HU in unenhanced imaging, 77 HU in contrast
enhanced data, and 40 HU in delayed imaging, consistent with a benign
adenoma.  There is no lymphadenopathy or free fluid.  Mild aortic
calcification extends into the iliac arteries.
 
Pelvis:
The urinary bladder appears normal.  The uterus is anteverted with
normal contours, and no adnexal mass is visible.  The colon has normal
contours and caliber.  The proximal (pericolonic) part of the appendix
is dilated to 11 mm, and it appears mildly enhancing, though there is
no periappendiceal edema.  This appearance is unchanged.  A few
reactive nodes are present in the adjacent mesentery.  No free fluid is
present.
 
ASSESSMENT:
The pericolonic part of the appendix is dilated and mildly enhancing.
This appearance is not significantly changed.  Mild or indolent
appendicitis could be considered.

INDICATION:  Right facial cellulitis with recent tooth extraction.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Individualized dose optimization technique was used for
this procedure.  2.5 mm axial CT images are obtained through the facial
bones, noncontrast, with coronal and sagittal reformatted images
provided.
 
COMPARISON:  No relevant recent prior study.
 
FINDINGS:  The visible mastoid air cells are clear. The posterior right
maxillary molar tooth is absent and a focus of gas is present in the
socket, compatible with recent tooth extraction as per clinical
history. There is probable odontogenic mucosal thickening present along
the floor of the right maxillary sinus.  A focus of gas in the right
cheek, best seen on axial image 39, may be within a vessel.  There is
adjacent soft tissue thickening and fat stranding present. Soft tissue
thickening extends posterior to the right maxillary sinus.
Subcutaneous fat stranding extends along the right chin with associated
thickening of the platysma on the right.  No discrete fluid collection
is present to suggest an abscess. Scattered bilateral cervical chain
lymph nodes are present, likely reactive, less than 1 cm in greatest
short-axis diameter.
 
IMPRESSION:  Findings compatible with right facial cellulitis likely
related to recent tooth extraction. No fluid collection is appreciated
to suggest an abscess on this noncontrast exam.

INDICATION:  encephalopathy/left side weakness
 
COMPARISON:  Head CT dated 04/13/2018.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar MRI examination of the brain was performed
without intravenous contrast.
 
FINDINGS:
 
The study is degraded by motion.
 
There is no evidence of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarct.
Global volume loss with associated ventricular dilatation.  The degree
of ventricular dilatation may be disproportionate to the background of
underlying volume loss.  Scattered nonspecific parenchymal FLAIR
hyperintensities are in the cerebral hemispheres.  No mass effect or
midline shift.  No abnormal extra-axial fluid collections.  Major
intracranial flow voids are grossly maintained.  No evidence of
parenchymal hemorrhage.  No gross abnormality of the sella.  The
basilar cisterns are patent.
 
Intravenous contrast was not administered.  Bilateral cataract surgery.
Mild paranasal sinus mucosal thickening.  Tiny left mastoid effusion.
 
 
 
IMPRESSION:
Motion degraded study showing no acute infarct.
 
Global volume loss with presumed chronic microvascular ischemic
changes.  The degree of ventricular dilatation is questionably
disproportionate to the background of underlying volume loss raising
the possibility of normal-pressure hydrocephalus.  Please clinically
correlate.

UNENHANCED HEAD CT.
 
CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Alcohol intake, with fall, head injury, and headache.
 
TECHNIQUE:
Axial thin images were obtained through the head from skull base to
vertex without administration of intravenous contrast material.
Individualized dose-optimization technique was utilized for the
procedure performed.
 
COMPARISON:
Head CT obtained April 3, 2018.
 
FINDINGS:
Mild diffuse parenchymal volume loss is present with commensurate
expansion of the CSF spaces.  There is no hemorrhage or extraaxial
hematoma.  No mass effect, edema, or gliosis is present.  To soft
tissue hematomas are present, ovary GI.  These are similar in
appearance to April 3.  Surgical reconstruction is present at the right
orbital floor left frontotemporal cranium.  Fluid layers in the left
maxillary sinus, which has patchy mucosal edema and osseous sclerosis.
And patchy left mastoid effusion is present.  The globes appear intact.
 
ASSESSMENT:
Mild atrophy.  Multiple previous cranial surgeries.  No evidence of an
acute brain parenchymal injury or new calvarial fracture. Left
maxillary sinus disease, incompletely imaged.
 
Note that MRI is more sensitive for detection of acute infarct, as it
can take several hours for brain cell death to result in CT-visible
tissue changes.

ADDENDUM:
Addendum:  I discussed this case by telephone with Dr. Schumaker.  At
this time, due to the significant extrahepatic disease, he will be
treated with systemic chemotherapy rather than locoregional therapy of
the liver.  He may still be a candidate for locoregional therapy in the
future.
 
<====== END ADDENDUM 04/14/2018 09:56 am ======>
 
HISTORY: .  A 6-year-old for followup of bowel lesion.  with arterial
and venous phase
 
REFERENCE: 02/27/2018 CT
 
TECHNIQUE:  Axial images from the lung bases to the ischium with 100
cubic centimeters Visipaque 320 IV contrast. Multiphase imaging is
performed.
 
FINDINGS:  Emphysematous change evident in the lower lungs.
Atelectasis and interstitial prominence in the right lower lobe.
 
Multiple hypervascular liver lesions are again demonstrated.  Largest
lesion lateral to the TIPS catheter is 4.5 cm, previously 4.8 cm.  2.1
cm lesion in the hepatic dome image 18 was previously 2 cm.  Some
lesions are better seen on today's exam during the arterial phase
component, but as compared to the December exam which had an arterial
phase scan, I do not suspect any increase in the number of lesions.
There is more defined intrahepatic low density at the posterior liver
spanning a region 10 cm cephalocaudad, but no frank fluid density in
this likely reflects regional edema/hepatitis. Gallstone within the
gallbladder.
 
The spleen is enlarged with at least one of low-density lesion in the
mid spleen image 121 unchanged from prior.  On portal venous phase
imaging there is some persistent heterogeneity in the spleen where I
cannot fully exclude developing subtle lesions, though these are not
identified on delayed imaging and may be therefore artifactual.
 
Pancreas, adrenals unremarkable.  Cortical thinning of both kidneys.
Parapelvic cyst of the lower right kidney is unchanged.
 
Mass in the mesentery 3.5 x 2.3 x 2.2 cm, measuring 3.6 x 2.5 x 2.3 cm
on December 4 scan mildly limited assessment on February scan due to
different timing of contrast but I suspect has been unchanged.
Retroperitoneal, periportal adenopathy does not appear significantly
changed for example node posterior to the portal vein image 135
measures 28 mm length on today's scan and on prior.  Again demonstrated
is a very compressed, not well defined IVC.  I do suspect there is some
enhancement in the IVC in the region of the right renal vein.

HISTORY: .  A 6-year-old for followup of bowel lesion.  with arterial
and venous phase
 
REFERENCE: 02/27/2018 CT
 
TECHNIQUE:  Axial images from the lung bases to the ischium with 100
cubic centimeters Visipaque 320 IV contrast. Multiphase imaging is
performed.
 
FINDINGS:  Emphysematous change evident in the lower lungs.
Atelectasis and interstitial prominence in the right lower lobe.
 
Multiple hypervascular liver lesions are again demonstrated.  Largest
lesion lateral to the TIPS catheter is 4.5 cm, previously 4.8 cm.  2.1
cm lesion in the hepatic dome image 18 was previously 2 cm.  Some
lesions are better seen on today's exam during the arterial phase
component, but as compared to the December exam which had an arterial
phase scan, I do not suspect any increase in the number of lesions.
There is more defined intrahepatic low density at the posterior liver
spanning a region 10 cm cephalocaudad, but no frank fluid density in
this likely reflects regional edema/hepatitis. Gallstone within the
gallbladder.
 
The spleen is enlarged with at least one of low-density lesion in the
mid spleen image 121 unchanged from prior.  On portal venous phase
imaging there is some persistent heterogeneity in the spleen where I
cannot fully exclude developing subtle lesions, though these are not
identified on delayed imaging and may be therefore artifactual.
 
Pancreas, adrenals unremarkable.  Cortical thinning of both kidneys.
Parapelvic cyst of the lower right kidney is unchanged.
 
Mass in the mesentery 3.5 x 2.3 x 2.2 cm, measuring 3.6 x 2.5 x 2.3 cm
on December 4 scan mildly limited assessment on February scan due to
different timing of contrast but I suspect has been unchanged.
Retroperitoneal, periportal adenopathy does not appear significantly
changed for example node posterior to the portal vein image 135
measures 28 mm length on today's scan and on prior.  Again demonstrated
is a very compressed, not well defined IVC.  I do suspect there is some
enhancement in the IVC in the region of the right renal vein.
Prominent collaterals are evident.
 
Urinary bladder wall thickening some decompression of the bladder.
Bowel is grossly unremarkable.  There is small amount of free fluid in
the right pericolic gutter.  Advanced vascular calcification.  Moderate
T12 compression unchanged.
 
IMPRESSION(S):
1.  Some heterogeneity of the spleen, may be related to contrast timing
but cannot exclude a subtle new lesions in the spleen.  Otherwise no
significant interval change since February 27
2.  Numerous hepatic masses, retroperitoneal/portocaval adenopathy, mid
mesenteric mass/adenopathy all grossly stable.  Hypodense/edematous
posterior right liver without frank fluid collection/abscess
3.  Occluded or near occluded IVC with extensive collaterals
4.  Cholelithiasis
5. Small amount of fluid in the pericolic gutter.
6.  Advanced vascular calcification
7.  Moderate T12 compression stable

INDICATION: 66-year male with shortness of breath and lower abdominal
pain.  Appendectomy and cesarean section 10 months ago.  Nausea.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Individualized dose optimization technique was used for
this procedure. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis performed axially
following intravenous administration of 100 ml Omnipaque contrast
injected into the 20-gauge, right antecubital fossa catheter. Coronal
and sagittal reformatted images are provided.
 
COMPARISON:  No relevant recent prior study.
 
FINDINGS:The visible lung bases are grossly clear. The liver,
gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are normal in
appearance. A homogeneous, round, right renal lesion up to 2.2 cm is
present in the lower pole right kidney which has an average Hounsfield
unit of 26. Minimal left perinephric fat stranding is present. Best
seen on coronal image 107, series 601, is a 1.8 cm, somewhat poorly
defined, slightly hypodense lesion in the lower pole of the left kidney
which has an average Hounsfield unit of 79, indeterminate. A small,
right lower quadrant ventral abdominal hernia is present.  A small,
fat-containing umbilical hernia is present. The appendix is not
identified, compatible with appendectomy. A 2.2 cm left ovarian cyst is
present. No free pelvic fluid is present.  No bowel obstruction or
pneumoperitoneum is present.
 
Impression:
 
1.  Heterogeneous, 1.8 cm lesion in the lower pole of the left kidney
with surrounding fat stranding.  This is of uncertain etiology.
Neoplasm cannot be excluded and follow-up with renal protocol CT/MRI is
recommended.  In the setting of pyelonephritis, however, an early renal
abscess is a consideration.  Correlate clinically.  Additionally, there
is a technically indeterminate, hypodense right renal lesion most
likely represents a cyst, but cannot be confidently diagnosis such on
this exam.
2. Fat-containing, ventral right lower quadrant and umbilical hernias.

CONTRAST-ENHANCED ANGIOGRAM CT OF THE RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY.
 
CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Right upper extremity crush injury.
 
TECHNIQUE:
Helical CT data were acquired through the right upper extremity from
the midportion of the forearm through the hand after administration of
intravenous contrast material.  Data were reconstructed into thin axial
images.  Sagittal, coronal, and three-dimensional reconstructions were
obtained.  The patient received 100 ml Omnipaque-300 without reported
adverse event.  Individualized dose-optimization technique was utilized
for the procedure performed.
 
COMPARISON:
There is no relevant prior study at this facility.
 
FINDINGS:
The radial artery is patent.  Its branches to the thenar tissues,
radial side index finger, and palmar arch are widely patent.  The ulnar
artery is widely patent.  It branches to the palmar arch, to the ulnar
side of the index finger, and to both sides of the small finger, ring
finger, and long finger are all patent.  The distal parts of the proper
digital arteries are obscured by edema or spasm, in the distal phalanx
of the small finger; the radial side of the long finger distal phalanx;
and the ulnar side of the small finger.  The dorsal interosseous artery
is patent, and it continues to the dorsal soft tissues of the hand.
There is edema in the deep tissues near the distal radial articular
surface and the proximal carpal row, but no defined fluid collection is
present.  No discrete tendon disruption is visible.  The bones of the
wrist, hand, and fingers are normally aligned and contoured
 
ASSESSMENT:
No evidence of wrist fracture.  The common and proper digital arteries
all appear widely patent into the fingertips, though at the fingertips
several of these are less well visualized as described above.

CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE CHEST.
 
CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Marfan syndrome with tearing chest pain.
 
TECHNIQUE:
Helical CT data were acquired through the chest, from the thoracic
inlet through the upper abdomen, during systemic artery enhancement.
Data were reconstructed into thin axial images.  Sagittal, coronal, and
three-dimensional reconstructions were obtained.  The patient received
100 ml Omnipaque-300 without reported adverse event.  Individualized
dose-optimization technique was utilized for the procedure performed.
 
COMPARISON:
There is no relevant prior study at this facility.
 
FINDINGS:
Contrast opacification of the thoracic aorta is adequate.  The aorta
has normal caliber and contours with no dissection or other acute
process.  The pulmonary artery is normal caliber and widely patent
centrally.  Heart size is normal though the left ventricle appears
mildly dilated.  The central airways are widely patent.  The lungs have
normal volume with no consolidation, edema, effusion, or pneumothorax.
Limited imaging of the upper abdomen reveals normal adrenal glands and
no acute abnormality.  A multilevel rod and screw construct is present
in the thoracolumbar spine, with no destructive or blastic bone lesion
superimposed.
 
ASSESSMENT:
No acute abnormality is visible.

CONTRAST-ENHANCED CT OF THE ABDOMEN.
CONTRAST-ENHANCED CT OF THE PELVIS.
 
CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Pelvic pain radiating to the back.
 
TECHNIQUE:
Helical CT data were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis, from the
lung bases through the pubic symphysis, after administration of
intravenous contrast material; no additional delayed data were
acquired.  Data were reconstructed into thin axial images.  Sagittal
and coronal reconstructions were obtained.  The patient received 100 ml
Omnipaque-300 without reported adverse event.  Individualized
dose-optimization technique was utilized for the procedure performed.
 
COMPARISON:
There is no relevant prior study at this facility. Multiple previous CT
evaluations from 2007 and earlier, are no longer available.
 
FINDINGS:
No significant osseous abnormality is present.
 
Abdomen:
Limited imaging of the lung bases reveals a 3 mm nodule in the
anterolateral basal left lower lobe on image 10.  No acute pulmonary or
pleural abnormality is present.
 
The liver, gallbladder, spleen pancreas, adrenal glands, abdominal GI
tract, and left kidney appear normal; the right kidney has moderate
scar and volume loss greater in its lower pole, with no enhancing
lesion or hydronephrosis.  Circumaortic left renal vein is noted. There
is mild atherosclerotic calcification in the iliac arteries.  There is
no lymphadenopathy or free fluid.
 
Pelvis:
The urinary bladder appears normal.  The uterus is anteverted with
mildly inhomogeneous enhancement suggesting a 2.1 x 1.8 cm posterior
leiomyoma.  The left ovary appears normal with a physiologic sized cyst
or follicle, and the right ovary appears normal. The colon and the
appendix appear normal.  Trace free fluid is within physiologic range,
and there is no lymphadenopathy.
 
ASSESSMENT:
1.  No evidence of an acute process to explain the patient's symptoms.
2.  Moderate right renal cortical scar and volume loss, with no
evidence of an acute process there.
3.  Physiologic appearance of the ovaries and adnexa.  Possible small
uterine leiomyoma of doubtful acute clinical consequence.
4.  Atherosclerotic disease, mild but nonetheless notable in this
39-year-old patient.
5.  3-mm left lower lobe pulmonary nodule.  If the patient has lung
cancer risk factors and if there is no previous CT still existing for
correlation, then a follow-up CT is recommended in 1 year.  If the
patient does not have lung cancer risk factors, then this nodule is so
small as to be of doubtful clinical consequence.

UNENHANCED CT OF THE ABDOMEN.
UNENHANCED CT OF THE PELVIS.
 
CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Pyelonephritis.  Hydronephrosis.
 
TECHNIQUE:
Helical CT data were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis, from the
lung bases through the pubic symphysis, without administration of
intravenous contrast material.  Data were reconstructed into thin axial
images.  Sagittal and coronal reconstructions were obtained.
Individualized dose-optimization technique was utilized for the
procedure performed.
 
COMPARISON:
Unenhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis obtained July 24, 2017.
 
FINDINGS:
Diffuse osteopenia is accompanied by moderate caudal lumbar facet
hypertrophy.  No destructive or blastic bone lesion is present.
Moderate pectus excavatum is noted.
 
Abdomen:
Limited imaging of the lung bases reveals mild dependent atelectasis or
scar with a 2 mm lingular nodule on image 1 unchanged.  Heart size is
normal.
 
Severe extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation is present with mild to
moderate intrahepatic ductal dilation.  This is unchanged and probably
represents postcholecystectomy remodeling. The spleen, adrenal glands,
and pancreas appear normal. Both kidneys have mild hydronephrosis and
hydroureter, and both ureters attach anterolateral to the bladder
trigone. Mild edema is present in the left pararenal fat but not on the
right. The unopacified abdominal GI tract has normal contours and
caliber. Moderate arterial calcification is present.  There is no
lymphadenopathy.
 
Pelvis:
The urinary bladder is surrounded by perivesical edema.  It has no
focal lesion.  The uterus has normal contours for age, and no adnexal
mass is visible.  The colon has multiple scattered diverticula, and the
rectum has moderate fecal matter volume without edema.  The appendix is
absent or obscured with no pericecal inflammation.  No pelvic
lymphadenopathy is present.
 
ASSESSMENT:
1.  Perivesical edema consistent with cystitis.
2.  Both of the ureters insert anterolateral to the bladder trigone,
either developmental or postsurgical.  There is bilateral mild
hydronephrosis and hydroureter.
3.  Left pararenal edema is consistent with the provided history of
pyelonephritis.  There is no similar edema on the right.

FINDINGS: Films of the left knee demonstrate a small suprapatellar
joint effusion. No definite acute fracture or dislocation is present.
There is mild tricompartmental joint space loss. Areas of lucency and
sclerosis in the distal femur and proximal tibia suggests prior
surgery. Please correlate with surgical history. The lateral view
demonstrates a well corticated osseous density along the anterior
aspect of the knee joint. This probably overlies the lateral knee joint
on the anterior view. This was probably present on the prior radiograph
and may represent remote fracture fragment or loose body.
 
IMPRESSION: Small suprapatellar joint effusion.  No definite acute
fracture or dislocation. Corticated osseous body within the knee joint
appears to have been present on previous exam and may represent loose
body. Bony changes in the distal femur and proximal tibia suggest prior
surgery.  Please correlate with surgical history.

UNENHANCED CT OF THE ABDOMEN.
UNENHANCED CT OF THE PELVIS.
 
CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Low abdominal pain.  Right-sided kidney stone.
 
TECHNIQUE:
Helical CT data were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis, from the
lung bases through the pubic symphysis, without administration of
intravenous contrast material.  Data were reconstructed into thin axial
images.  Sagittal and coronal reconstructions were obtained.
Individualized dose-optimization technique was utilized for the
procedure performed.
 
COMPARISON:
There is no relevant prior study at this facility.
 
FINDINGS:
No significant osseous abnormality is present.
 
Abdomen:
Limited imaging of the lung bases reveals minimal atelectasis or scar
in the lateral right middle lobe, and a small sliding hiatal hernia
with mild circumferential edema.
 
The gallbladder is filled with dense sludge or innumerable tiny
calculi.  No ductal dilation is present.  The liver, spleen, pancreas,
and adrenal glands appear normal.  The left kidney contains at least
three calculi up to 2 mm.  The right kidney contains at least four
calculi which all appear punctate.  No hydronephrosis or ureteral
calculus is visible.  The abdominal GI tract appears normal.  There is
no free fluid or lymphadenopathy.
 
Pelvis:
The ovaries, positioned just right of midline anteriorly, distorted by
a 10.7 x 10.4 x 8.4 cm mass with cystic, calcific, soft tissue, and
adipose components; and multiple other adipose nodules are present
nearby.  A second adipose mass is present posterior to the lower
uterine segment, on the right, suggesting that the large lesion is in
the left ovary, which is displaced somewhat.  The uterus itself has no
focal lesion.  Small-volume free fluid is within physiologic range
though it is nonspecific.  The colon has normal contours and caliber.
The appendix appears normal.  There is no lymphadenopathy.
 
ASSESSMENT:
1.  Bilateral nonobstructing renal calculi.  No hydronephrosis or
visible ureteral calculus.
2.  The gallbladder is abnormal.  It is filled with dense sludge or
innumerable tiny calculi.
3.  Mixed tissue-type lesions at the adnexa consistent with dermoids,
as described above.

A left femoral nail and a right hip construct are incompletely imaged.
Remote prior left lateral rib fractures are healed with mild deformity.
No destructive or blastic bone lesion is superimposed.
 
Chest:
Moderate atelectasis is present, greatest in the dependent bases. Trace
effusions are present. There is no mass or nodule.  Moderate
cardiomegaly is present with moderate calcification of the mitral valve
annulus.  Mild lymphadenopathy is present in the mediastinum. The
ascending aorta is 41 x 40 mm.
 
Abdomen:
The liver, spleen, right adrenal gland, and abdominal GI tract appear
normal.  The pancreas has moderate fatty infiltration.  The left
adrenal gland is thickened but retains adreniform shape consistent with
hyperplasia.  The kidneys have mild volume loss and lobulation but no
enhancing lesion is visible.  The infrarenal aorta is aneurysmal up to
25 x 27 mm.  Dilation continues into the common iliac arteries.  There
is no lymphadenopathy.
 
Pelvis:
The urinary bladder is collapsed with a Foley catheter.  The prostate
gland is obscured by confluent beam-hardening artifacts.  The colon has
normal contours and caliber, and the appendix appears normal.  No free
fluid is present and no lymphadenopathy is visible.
 
ASSESSMENT:
1.  Bilateral dependent atelectasis or consolidation.  Consider
aspiration pneumonia.  Trace effusions and lymphadenopathy associated.
2.  Cardiomegaly.
3.  Ascending thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms.
4.  No evidence of malignancy in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis.

Working DX: C09.9-Malignant neoplasm of tonsil, unspecified
 

 
EXAMINATION:  NUCLEAR MEDICINE 18-FDG PET-CT, 04/13/2018
 
INDICATION: 62-year-old F with given reason for exam of "Malignant
neoplasm of tonsil, unspecified." The patient reports no treatment
since prior PET-CT.
 
TECHNIQUE:  PET-CT images were obtained from skull vertex through the
proximal thighs 75 minutes following intravenous administration of
12.18 mCi of 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose.  Fusion imaging was performed at a
separate workstation.  Blood glucose level was 101 mg/dL.
Individualized radiation dose reduction techniques were used.
 
COMPARISON:  11/09/2017
 
FINDINGS:  There is prompt uptake of radiotracer in the floor the
mouth/oral cavity region, uncertain how much of this is physiologic.
In the area of previous right tonsillar tear, max SUV up to
approximately 9 grams per mL, previously 12.6.
 
No overt hypermetabolism seen in the cervical adenopathy at this time.
 
The previous "first" index right superior cervical node, level IIa,
currently is only 3 mm in short axis, previously 12 mm.  Again, no
abnormal hypermetabolism in the region at this time.
 
The "second" right superior cervical node, also level IIa, is no longer
perceptible on CT or PET.
 
The index left superior cervical node, level IIa, currently also only 3
mm in short axis, previously 7 mm.  Again, not overtly hypermetabolic.
 
There is some new focal hypermetabolism in the chest, but this seems to
correspond to non mass-like infiltrate posterior left lung base with
adjacent tree-in-bud type nodularity suspect inflammation in the
setting of atypical pneumonia rather than neoplasm in that location.
 
Some inflammatory activity noted at the insertion site of the left
upper quadrant abdominal percutaneous gastrostomy tube as might be
expected.  Degree of inflammation here appears decreased on PET
compared with prior.  Quite asymmetric uptake of FDG seen in right
paraspinal musculature in the mid low back.  Given focal nature and
some stranding, may be inflammation in the muscle.  Doubt underlying
tumor.
 
Activity at the right lower quadrant ostomy is slightly less impressive
than on previous exam.
 
There is less urinary bladder activity than expected.  Correlation with
renal function testing suggested.
 
Some inflammatory activity noted in the subcutaneous region near the
left femoral greater trochanter, but no overlying cutaneous defect or
drainable fluid collection or underlying osseous erosion identified.
 
Otherwise, I see physiologic distribution of radiotracer throughout the
neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis, with no focal hypermetabolism seen to
suggest metastatic disease.
 
CT imaging shows port in place with catheter tip to the superior
cavoatrial junction.  Heart size is normal.  Lungs are moderately
hyperinflated.  Some discoid scarring seen in the upper lung zones.
Calcified granuloma seen in the right middle lobe.  There is calcific
atherosclerotic plaque abdominal aorta but no AAA.  Gallbladder remains
in place.  No abdominal adenopathy evident.  Urinary bladder appears
somewhat full.
 
There is focal kyphosis near the thoracolumbar junction, chronic. Some
chronic remodeling of the posterior elements in the region, likely due
to chronic pressure.
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  Some activity in the pharyngeal mucosal space, uncertain if any
residual primary tumor or whether this be simply physiologic or
inflammatory. Of course, correlation with direct visualization could be
considered in that regard.
2.  No PET-CT evidence seen to suggest active metastatic disease.
Previous index adenopathy in the neck basically resolved.
3.  Question new atypical pneumonia infiltrate posterior basal left
lower lobe of the lung on top of chronic lung pulmonary hyperinflation.
No pleural effusion.
4.  Perhaps some inflammation subcutaneous left hip region.
5.  Other generally chronic-appearing CT findings as discussed above.
 
This patient was released based upon guidelines established in TN State
Regulations for Protection Against Radiation, Chapter 0400-20-07-.35,

CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE CHEST.
 
CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Elevated D-dimer and chest pain.
 
TECHNIQUE:
Helical CT data were acquired through the chest, from the thoracic
inlet through the upper abdomen, during pulmonary artery enhancement.
Data were reconstructed into thin axial images.  Sagittal, coronal, and
bilateral coronal oblique reconstructions were obtained.  The patient
received 100 ml Omnipaque-300 without reported adverse event.
Individualized dose-optimization technique was utilized for the
procedure performed.
 
COMPARISON:
There is no relevant prior study at this facility.
 
FINDINGS:
Note:  Final interpretation was delayed by a computer malfunction.
 
Contrast opacification of the pulmonary arteries is excellent.  These
arteries are normal caliber without intraluminal thrombus.  Contrast
opacification of the thoracic aorta is adequate to exclude an acute
aortic process.  Heart size is normal.  There is no pericardial
effusion.
 
There is a centrally calcified nodule in the medial basal left lower
lobe though it has a noncalcified periphery.  No consolidation, edema,
or effusion is present.  The central airways are widely patent.  There
is no noncalcified mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
 
There is edema at the duodenum descending segment (see image 104) with
no visible focal lesion.  The rest of the duodenum is not in the field
of view.  There is focal fat in the medial hepatic segment near the
intersegmental fissure.  The gallbladder is surgically absent with no
biliary ductal dilation.  The adrenal glands appear normal.
 
No significant osseous abnormality is present.
 
ASSESSMENT:
1.  Circumferential edema at the descending duodenum, incompletely
imaged.  Considerations include duodenitis or ulcer disease.
2.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.  No acute pulmonary or pleural
abnormality.
3.  Centrally calcified though not completely calcified nodule in the
left lower lobe.  If there is no prior study elsewhere that can be used
for documentation of stability then a follow-up CT is recommended in 1
year.

Procedure Ordered: 13583704~68033~FPET CT SKUL-MD THI INIT~78815PI~99999501
Admitting DX: C34.90-Malignant neoplasm of unsp part of unsp bronchus or lung
Working DX: C34.90-Malignant neoplasm of unsp part of unsp bronchus or lung
 

 
EXAMINATION:  NUCLEAR MEDICINE 18-FDG PET-CT, 04/13/2018
 
INDICATION: 80-year-old F with given reason for exam of "Malignant
neoplasm of unspecified part of bronchus or lung." Squamous cell
carcinoma, moderately differentiated left upper lobe.
 
TECHNIQUE:  PET-CT images were obtained from the mid skull through the
proximal thighs 70 minutes following intravenous administration of
14.21 mCi of 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose.  Fusion imaging was performed at a
separate workstation.  Blood glucose level was 74 mg/dL.
Individualized radiation dose reduction techniques were used.
 
COMPARISON:  CT chest 03/05/2018, CT for biopsy 03/22/2018.
 
FINDINGS:  The biopsy lesion near the junction of the anterior segment
and superior lingular segment of the left upper lobe of the lung
currently measures 3.6 x 2.3 cm in size, and is hypermetabolic with max
SUV up to 26.4 grams per mL.
 
No other satellite lung nodularity noted.  No pleural effusion or
pleural nodularity.  There is no central mediastinal or hilar
lymphadenopathy.
 
I see no hypermetabolic hepatic or adrenal metastasis.  Scattered
activity throughout the abdomen pelvis believed benign physiologic
bowel uptake and urinary excretion.
 
In the neck, no discrete hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy seen.  However,
there is considerable high-level FDG uptake throughout the markedly
enlarged thyroid gland with some sternal extension.  Given diffuse
nature here, suspect thyroiditis rather than thyroid malignancy. And
thought not to be related to the primary lesion left upper lobe of the
lung.
 
Focal FDG activity in the visible left upper extremity near the elbow
believed artifact related to local radiotracer administration.
 
CT imaging shows moderate calcific atherosclerotic plaque in the
carotid aortic and coronary distribution.  There is at least mild
cardiomegaly.  Normal benign non-metabolic cyst seen supra pole right
kidney.  There is mild pre-aneurysmal ectasia of the abdominal aorta
but no large AAA.  Gallbladder remains in place.  There is no ascites
or abnormal peritoneal nodularity.
 
There is evidence of previous hysterectomy.  A chronic peripherally
mineralized hypoattenuating process seen in the right paramidline
pelvis, question chronic pelvic hematoma.  This process the right
hemi-pelvis is similar to CT from May 2012.  There is evidence of
interval total right hip arthroplasty, beam-hardening from which is
obscures detail somewhat in the pelvic region at this time.
 
There is mild edema in the left thigh greater than right, nonspecific.
I see no obvious mass in the pelvis compressing the iliac venous system.
 
Other visible osseous structures reveal degenerative changes,
particularly lower lumbar facet joints.  I see no acute or aggressive
appearing osseous process.
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  Hypermetabolic mass left upper lobe of the lung, consistent given
history.  I see no associated regional nodal involvement or distant
metastatic disease.
2.  Hypermetabolic thyroid goiter with substernal extension.  Favor
thyroiditis rather than thyroid malignancy.  This is thought unrelated
to the chest malignancy, but still might be clinically significant.
Suggest appropriate thyroid function testing correlation.
3.  Asymmetric edema left thigh.  Nonspecific, though correlation with
deep venous duplex sonography could be considered in attempt to exclude
associated DVT.
4.  Other incidental chronic-appearing CT findings, as above.
 
This patient was released based upon guidelines established in TN State
Regulations for Protection Against Radiation, Chapter 0400-20-07-.35,
Release of Individuals Containing Radioactive Drugs or Implants.

LIMITED OBSTETRIC SONOGRAM:  endovaginal imaging.
 
CLINICAL INFORMATION:
This 19-year-old female patient presents for evaluation of abdominal
pain.  She has a positive urine pregnancy test.  She is unsure of the
dates of her last menstrual period.
 
TECHNIQUE:
Real-time high-resolution endovaginal grey-scale and color/spectral
Doppler sonographic evaluation of the developing gestation.
 
COMPARISON:
There is no relevant prior study at this facility.
 
FINDINGS:
Image quality is adequate.
 
The cervix appears normal, with length 3.1 cm.  The uterus is
anteverted and retroflexed.  It has long-axis dimension 8.7 cm,
short-axis dimension 3.9 cm, and transverse dimension 4.5 cm. A curved
ovoid gestational sac is present at the uterine fundus, 2.49 x 1.81 x
1.27 cm.  A yolk sac is 3-4 mm in diameter.  A tiny embryo is present
with crown-rump length measured 3.6 mm, and heart rate measured 106-108
beats per minute. No subchorionic fluid is visible.
 
The left ovary is 2.9 x 2.6 x 2.3 cm, with normal contours,
echogenicity, and blood flow.  The right ovary is not visible.
Small-volume free fluid is present, with no visible adnexal mass.
 
ASSESSMENT:
1.  The uterus is anteverted and retroflexed.  A gestational sac at the
fundus contains a single living embryo.  Average ultrasound age is 6
weeks 4 days, based on mean sac diameter and embryonic crown-rump
length. No acute gestational process is visible.
2. Small-volume free fluid is present in the pelvis.  This is
nonspecific but it is abnormal in a pregnant patient. Heterotopic
gestation is a theoretical consideration though this is quite uncommon.
Otherwise, non-obstetric etiologies (such as enteritis) may be
considered.
3.  The left ovary is sonographically normal.  The right ovary was
obscured.

CONTRAST-ENHANCED CT OF THE ABDOMEN.
CONTRAST-ENHANCED CT OF THE PELVIS.
 
CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Abdominal pain.  History of Crohn disease.
 
TECHNIQUE:
Helical CT data were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis, from the
lung bases through the pubic symphysis, after administration of
intravenous contrast material; no additional delayed data were
acquired.  Data were reconstructed into thin axial images.  Sagittal
and coronal reconstructions were obtained.  The patient received 100 ml
Omnipaque-300 without reported adverse event.  Individualized
dose-optimization technique was utilized for the procedure performed.
 
COMPARISON:
There is no relevant prior study at this facility.
 
FINDINGS:
No significant osseous abnormality is present.
 
Abdomen:
Limited imaging of the lung bases reveals no significant pulmonary or
pleural abnormality.
 
The liver, spleen, pancreas, gallbladder, adrenal glands, and left
kidney appear normal.  There is a 12 x 12 mm inhomogeneously dense or
enhancing nodule at the lateral lower pole of the right kidney.  The
contrast-filled abdominal GI tract has normal contours and caliber.
There is no lymphadenopathy, free fluid, or free air.
 
Pelvis:
The urinary bladder appears normal, and the prostate gland is not
enlarged.  The colon has normal contours and caliber, and the appendix
appears normal.  A few reactive nodes are present in the right lower
quadrant mesentery.  There is no true lymphadenopathy and no free fluid
is present.
 
ASSESSMENT:
1.  Right renal mass is either dense or enhancing, and renal carcinoma
is a consideration.  This should be characterized with a multiphase CT
or MRI.
2.  Reactive nodes in the right lower quadrant mesentery but no focal
GI abnormality.

MRI OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH GADOLINIUM ENHANCEMENT.
 
CLINICAL INFORMATION:
This 19-year-old male patient presented for evaluation of abdominal
pain and was found to have an inhomogeneous dense or enhancing mass at
the lower pole of the right kidney.
 
TECHNIQUE:
Multiplanar multisequenc imaging data were acquired through the
abdominal viscera before and after administration of gadolinium agent.
The patient received 14 ml MultiHance agent without reported adverse
event.  Fat sensitive, fat-suppressed, fluid-sensitive, chemical shift,
and dynamic enhancement data were acquired.
 
COMPARISON:
Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis obtained April 14, 2018.
 
FINDINGS:
Limited imaging of the lung bases reveals no significant pulmonary or
pleural abnormality.
 
The liver, spleen, pancreas, gallbladder, adrenal glands, and imaged
loops of the small intestines and colon appear normal.  The left kidney
appears normal.  The right kidney is distorted by a round
T1-hypointense and inhomogeneously T2-hyperintense lesion at its
anterolateral lower pole, 11 x 11 x 11 mm. No free fluid or
lymphadenopathy is present.
 
Following administration of intravenous gadolinium agent, there is
inhomogeneous enhancement in the renal lesion, more lobulated and
linear.  Elsewhere no additional site of abnormal enhancement is
present.
 
Imaged thoracolumbar vertebral bone marrow has normal signal
characteristics.
 
ASSESSMENT:
A T2-hyperintense lesion in the anterolateral right renal lower pole
undergoes inhomogeneous somewhat complex or lobulated enhancement
following administration of intravenous gadolinium agent.  Renal cell
carcinoma remains a primary consideration.

INDICATION:  tia, LUE weakness
 
COMPARISON:  Head CT dated 04/13/2018.  Brain MRI dated 02/13/2018 and
05/20/2016.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar MRI examination of the brain was performed
without intravenous contrast.
 
FINDINGS:
There is no evidence of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarct.
 
Postoperative changes in the left frontal region are again demonstrated
with the resection cavity subjacent to craniotomy site.  Extensive
FLAIR hyperintensity is present in the adjacent parenchyma, at least
some of which likely reflects gliosis. There is mild thickening along
the left side of the anterior interhemispheric falx which is poorly
assessed without intravenous contrast.  Background of global volume
loss with associated ventricular dilatation.  Some scattered
nonspecific FLAIR hyperintensities are present elsewhere in the
cerebral hemispheres.  No midline shift.  Major intracranial flow voids
are grossly maintained. Aside from hemosiderin deposition in the left
frontal resection cavity there is no evidence of intracranial
hemorrhage elsewhere.  No gross abnormality of the sella.  The basilar
cisterns are patent.
 
Intravenous contrast was not administered.  Bilateral cataract surgery.
Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
 
IMPRESSION:
No acute intracranial abnormality.  No acute infarct.
 
Postoperative changes in the left frontal region.  There is probably
some residual meningioma along the anterior interhemispheric falx but
this is poorly evaluated without intravenous contrast.
 
Global volume loss with presumed chronic microvascular ischemic
changes.

FINDINGS:
Soft tissue injury is present at the index, long, ring, and small
finger soft tissues.  Dense dressing material is present which would
obscure a potential small foreign body but no large radiopaque body is
visible.  The fingers are not splayed in the lateral projection, which
reduces sensitivity for detection of nondisplaced fracture, but no
fracture or dislocation is visible.  More proximally the bones of the
carpus are normally aligned.  There is a remodeled fragment at the
ulnar styloid process tip perhaps reflecting a remote prior injury.
 
ASSESSMENT:
Soft tissue injury as described.  No evidence of fracture, within
limitations.

CONTRAST-ENHANCED CT OF THE LUMBAR SPINE.
 
CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Low back pain.  Previous back surgery.
 
TECHNIQUE:
Helical CT data were acquired through the lumbar spine from T12 through
S4 after administration of intravenous contrast material, and
reconstructed into thin axial, coronal, and sagittal images.  The
patient received 75 ml Visipaque 320 without reported adverse event.
Individualized dose-optimization technique was utilized for the
procedure performed.
 
COMPARISON:
There is no relevant prior study at this facility.
 
FINDINGS:
Severe diffuse osteopenia is present.  Five lumbar vertebral bodies are
present, with normal height of the each level.  Contours are normal
other than degenerative changes which are described below.  There is 2
mm anterior borderline spondylolisthesis at L4-5, with normal alignment
elsewhere.
 
The caudal erector spinae musculature has severe fatty infiltration and
atrophy, in its medial tissues, and milder change more laterally.  More
cranially, the paraspinal muscles have normal contours and attenuation.
Limited imaging of internal pelvic viscera reveals scattered colonic
diverticula and extensive vascular calcification, both incompletely
imaged.  The extrahepatic biliary duct system is dilated though the
pancreatic duct is normal caliber.  A duodenal diverticulum is noted.
A left renal cyst is at least 55 x 52 mm, and smaller lesions are
present at the upper pole.  The right kidney has multiple tiny cysts
too small for internal characterization.  The sacroiliac joints are
normally aligned in the field of view.
 
Each level is described individually:
 
T12-L1:  Mild disc-osteophyte complex at the right posterolateral
quadrant, with no focal protrusion.  No canal or foraminal stenosis.
 
L1-2:  Mild circumferential disc-osteophyte complex with no for minimal
facet hypertrophy.  No canal or foraminal stenosis.
 
L2-3:  Mild circumferential disc-osteophyte complex and disc bulge with
no focal protrusion.  Mild facet hypertrophy and ligamentum flavum
thickening.  No canal, foraminal, or lateral recess stenosis.
 
L3-4:  Severe loss of disc height, with large irregular circumferential
disc-osteophyte complex but no focal protrusion.  Mild facet
hypertrophy but pronounced ligamentum flavum thickening.  Severe
bilateral lateral recess stenosis.  The thecal sac is narrowed to 8 mm
in AP diameter.  There is severe right and moderate left foraminal
stenosis.
 
L4-5:  Moderate to severe loss of disc height, with large irregular
circumferential disc-osteophyte complex and disc bulge.  Severe facet
hypertrophy and severe ligamentum flavum thickening and calcification.
Severe bilateral lateral recess stenosis.  The thecal sac is 8 mm in AP
diameter.  Severe bilateral foraminal stenosis is present, slightly
worse on the left.
 
L5-S1:  Moderate to severe loss of disc height with a large posterior
calcified disc bulge from one foramen to the other, but no focal
protrusion superimposed.  Mild facet hypertrophy.  Previous
laminectomy.  Nonetheless severe bilateral foraminal stenosis.  No
lateral recess or canal stenosis.
 
No discrete enhancing lesion is visible in the spinal canal or in the
foramina.
 
ASSESSMENT:
1.  Previous laminectomy posterior to L5-S1. No discrete abnormal
enhancement in this CT.
2.  Severe multilevel degenerative changes resulting in canal,
foraminal, and lateral recess stenoses in the mid to caudal lumbar
levels as described.  Each level is detailed above.
3.  Arterial disease, renal cysts, and other incidental findings as
described.

EXAMINATION:  NUCLEAR MEDICINE 18-FDG PET-CT, 04/13/2018
 
INDICATION: 48-year-old F with given reason for exam of "Malignant
neoplasm of cervix uteri, unspecified." Stage IIIB at surgery.
Radiation and chemotherapy, last dose 1 month and 1.5 months ago,
respectively.
 
TECHNIQUE:  PET-CT images were obtained from the mid skull through the
proximal thighs 85 minutes following intravenous administration of
10.57 mCi of 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose.  Fusion imaging was performed at a
separate workstation.  Blood glucose level was 110 mg/dL.
Individualized radiation dose reduction techniques were used.
 
COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and pelvis without contrast 02/11/2018, CT
chest with contrast 02/08/2018, prior PET CT 11/28/2017.
 
FINDINGS:   Overall, I see physiologic distribution of radiotracer
throughout the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis, with no focal
hypermetabolism seen to suggest FDG-avid metastasis.  And, even at the
cervix, no abnormal hypermetabolism identified at this time.  Previous
vaginal wall/cervical thickening is generally subjectively less
prominent currently as well.  Although there is some architectural
distortion in the region, that could be post-therapeutic change, not
necessarily viable tumor.  Unable to provide a precise measurement
anatomically here.
 
CT imaging shows mild residual or recurrent left hydronephrosis, but
less impressive than on CT from February 11. Previous right-sided
hydronephrosis has resolved.  Bilateral double pigtail ureteral stents
remain in place with distal aspects in the urinary bladder.
 
There is evidence of previous proximal left humeral fixation.  Port is
in place with catheter tip only barely to the subclavian vein.  This
may a pullback somewhat, tip could even potentially be extravascular,
uncertain. Would suggest either revision or at least chest port
injection prior to any subsequent use.  I see no mediastinal or hilar
non-mineralized adenopathy.  Old granulomas calcification seen right
hilum.  Heart is borderline in size.  No pleural or pericardial
effusion.  The I see no worrisome pulmonary parenchymal nodularity.
 
Spleen is near upper limits of normal in size.  No adrenal mass noted.
Gallbladder remains in place.  There is no peritoneal nodularity.  No
ascites.  There is mild abdominal aortic atherosclerosis but no AAA.
There is some minimal sigmoid colon diverticulosis.
 
I see no obvious pelvic sidewall mass or other pelvic lymphadenopathy.
Visible osseous structures reveal moderate degenerative disease and
facet arthrosis lower lumbar region.  I see no acute or aggressive
appearing osseous process.
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  No PET-CT evidence of recurrence or metastasis of patient's
malignancy.
2.  Mild left hydronephrosis, though decreased prominence compared with
February 2018.  No right-sided hydronephrosis at this time.  Bilateral
double pigtail ureteral stents remain.
3.  Other chronic findings as above.
 
This patient was released based upon guidelines established in TN State
Regulations for Protection Against Radiation, Chapter 0400-20-07-.35,

MRI OF THE ABDOMEN.
MAGNETIC RESONANCE CHOLANGIOPANCREATOGRAPHY.
 
CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Pancreatitis.
 
TECHNIQUE:
Multiplanar multisequence imaging data were acquired through the
abdominal viscera without administration of intravenous gadolinium
agent.  Fat sensitive, fat-suppressed, fluid-sensitive, chemical shift,
and MRCP sequences were performed
 
COMPARISON:
Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis obtained April 13, 2018.
 
FINDINGS:
Limited imaging of the lung bases reveals moderate left and small right
pleural effusions.
 
The pancreas is edematous.  It is surrounded by peripancreatic edema
and there is large-volume fluid throughout the peritoneum. There is no
defined collection, visible glandular necrosis, or mass. The
gallbladder is filled with calculi.  MRCP data reveal no intraductal
calculus.  No hepatobiliary or pancreatic ductal dilation is present.
No liver lesion is present.  The portal vein and splenic vein are
patent.  The adrenal glands, spleen, and kidneys appear normal.  The
abdominal GI tract appears normal within intrinsic motion limitations,
as do included segments of the colon.
 
ASSESSMENT:
The pancreas is diffusely edematous consistent with pancreatitis.  No
hepatobiliary or pancreatic ductal dilation is present and there is no
choledocholithiasis (though numerous gallstones are present within the
gallbladder lumen).  Extensive free fluid and edema are present within
the peritoneum, increased since the previous study.  Bilateral pleural
effusions have developed, larger on the left than on the right.  The
portal vein is patent. No pancreatic necrosis, defined peripancreatic
collection, or pancreatic mass is visible.

CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST ENHANCEMENT.
CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST ENHANCEMENT.
CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST ENHANCEMENT.
 
CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Syncope, nausea, and seizure-like activity.
 
TECHNIQUE:
Helical CT data were acquired through the chest, abdomen, and pelvis,
from the lung bases through the pubic symphysis, in unenhanced and
systemic arterial phases, with additional abdominal delayed imaging.
Data were reconstructed into thin axial images.  Sagittal, coronal, and
three-dimensional reconstructions were obtained.  The patient received
100 ml Visipaque 320 without reported adverse event.  Individualized
dose-optimization technique was utilized for the procedure performed.
 
COMPARISON:
CT of the chest obtained March 23, 2018.
 
FINDINGS:
Moderate degenerative changes are present in the lumbar spine and in
the imaged caudal cervical spine.  No destructive or blastic bone
lesion is present.  A previous fracture is present in the lateral left
ninth rib.
 
Chest:
Heart size is normal but a moderate pericardial effusion is present, up
to 21 mm "thick."  The septum is not shifted.  Severe coronary
calcification is present.  A right chest port catheter terminates in
the right atrium.  The aorta has moderate atherosclerotic disease but
no acute aortic process is present.  This study was not performed for
pulmonary embolism evaluation but the central pulmonary arteries are
patent.
 
Small bilateral pleural effusions are present, occupying less than 10%
of each hemithorax.  There is no interlobular septal edema or focal
alveolar consolidation.  Mild partially calcified apical scar is
present with mild bullous changes.  Mild atelectasis is present in the
bases.
 
Abdomen:
The abdominal aorta has moderate mixed calcific and non calcific
plaque, and bilateral iliac artery stents are present, longer on the
left than on the right.  There is no evidence of an acute aortic
process. Major aortic branches are patent with moderate calcific and
non calcific plaque.
 
The liver is cirrhotic in configuration, with no focal lesion.  The
gallbladder is edematous.  The spleen is not enlarged.  No varix is
present.  The adrenal glands are multilobulated, as in the recent prior
study.  The kidneys, pancreas, and abdominal GI tract appear normal.
There is no lymphadenopathy.
 
Pelvis:
The iliac arteries and the imaged femoral artery segments are patent
with moderate atherosclerotic disease but no evidence of an acute
process.  The urinary bladder is collapsed with no visible abnormality.
The prostate gland is absent.  The colon has large-volume rectal fecal
matter, without edema, and moderate volume fecal material in the rest
of its length.  A few diverticula are present without evidence of
diverticulitis.  The appendix appears normal.  No free fluid or
lymphadenopathy is present.
 
ASSESSMENT:
1.  No evidence of an acute aortic process.  Extensive atherosclerotic
disease.  Severe coronary artery calcification. Moderate pericardial
effusion new since the recent prior study.
2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions with mild basilar atelectasis. No
pulmonary edema
3.  Cirrhotic liver configuration with no focal lesion or splenomegaly.
4. Gallbladder wall edema.  In the setting of hepatic cirrhosis this
could be due to inflammation or portal hypertension.
5.  Moderate fecal material in the colon, and large-volume material in
the rectum, with scattered colonic diverticula but no evidence of an
acute colonic inflammatory process.

MRI BRAIN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST
 
INDICATION:  Multiple sclerosis.  New onset of weakness and vision loss
in left eye.
 
COMPARISON:  None available.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar MRI examination of the brain was performed
without intravenous contrast. Patient was unable to complete exam due
to pain.
 
FINDINGS:
There is no evidence of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarct.
 
There are a few tiny nonspecific FLAIR hyperintensities in the deep
white matter of the cerebral hemispheres for example in the left
frontal lobe on series 3 image 13.  No mass effect or midline shift.
No abnormal extra-axial fluid collections.  Major intracranial flow
voids are grossly maintained.  No increased susceptibility to suggest
parenchymal hemorrhage.  No gross abnormality of the sella.  The
basilar cisterns are patent.
 
Intravenous contrast was not administered.  No gross orbital
abnormalities.  Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
 
IMPRESSION:
No acute intracranial abnormality.  No acute infarct.
 
Tiny nonspecific parenchymal FLAIR hyperintensities. These are not
specific for multiple sclerosis and could be due to accelerated
microvascular ischemic change as the patient reports a history of
diabetes and hypertension. Correlation with any previous brain MRI
studies which may have been performed at an outside institution would
be helpful if available to assess for interval change.

Working DX: C20-Malignant neoplasm of rectum
 

EXAMINATION:  MRI PELVIS/RECTUM WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST,  04/13/2018
 
INDICATION: 77-year-old M with given reason for exam of "rectal
cancer."  Restaging, reported residual ulcer on recent proctoscopy.
Radiation and chemotherapy, last dose reportedly last week.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar multisequence MR images obtained of the pelvis
prior to and following intravenous administration of 17 mL MultiHance
Gadolinium contrast media.  Lubricating jelly (120 mL) injected into
the rectal lumen and 1 mg of intramuscular glucagon administered, both
immediately prior to the exam.
 
COMPARISON:  CT 12/21/2017, prior MRI 08/28/2017
 
FINDINGS:
 
Tumor:  Not visualized at this time.
Muscularis propria appears generally intact throughout the rectal
region.  Superiorly, approximately 14 cm from the anal verge, there is
close apposition of the rectosigmoid junction to the peritoneal
reflection in the right paramidline, reference axial T2 series 8 image
11, sagittal T2 series 10 image 10. I wonder if this could be focal
post-therapeutic scarring. There may be an associated mucosal defect in
the 11-12 o'clock position; could this be the ulcer seen on lower
endoscopy?
Mesorectal fat:  Potentially involved as above, though not otherwise
clearly involved.
Mesorectal fascia:  Potentially involved as above, though otherwise not
involved.
Pelvic organs:  Not involved
Sphincter invasion:  None
Peritoneal reflection:  Potentially involved as above.
 
Lymph nodes:
Mesorectum:  Not involved at this time
Inguinal:  Not involved
Iliac chain:  Not involved
 
Bone marrow:  Fatty infiltration of the marrow.
 
Other: Heterogeneity of the prostate with perhaps prior TURP type
procedure.  Technique not optimized for detailed prosthetic evaluation.
Deep veins of the pelvis reveal no DVT.  Slight thickening of
hyperenhancement of the mucosa of the rectum may be post-therapeutic
inflammatory change.  Similar hyperenhancement of the sigmoid colon and
urinary bladder mucosal lining.  Mild indirect fatty hernia along the
right spermatic cord vessels.  No inflammation or a associated
involvement bowel
 
IMPRESSION:  Post-therapeutic changes with perhaps focal scarring at
the colorectal junction in the right paramidline extending to the
peritoneal reflection.  Some inflammation.  No perceptible/measurable
tumor identified at this time.  No adenopathy in the region.
 
Note: While, in the literature, it appears that MRI is considered
accurate in identifying advanced stage T3 tumors,
findings that help distinguish early stage T3 tumors from stage T2
tumors can be quite subtle and difficult to reliably discern.

MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST
 
INDICATION:  sz, pres, mets.  Headache.  Seizure.  History of squamous
carcinoma of scalp.
 
COMPARISON:  Head CT dated 04/13/2018. Brain MRI dated 04/08/2018.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar MRI of the brain was performed before and after
the administration of 20 ml Multihance IV contrast.
 
FINDINGS:
 
The study is degraded by motion.
 
T2-hyperintense extra-axial collection over the right lateral cerebral
convexity is unchanged, measuring up to 13 mm maximum dimension.  This
causes slight mass effect upon the subjacent parenchyma with minimal
right to left midline shift, similar.
 
Global volume loss with associated ventricular dilatation.  Patchy
areas of FLAIR hyperintensity are again demonstrated in the cerebral
hemispheres.  These are for the most part unchanged except for new
ill-defined FLAIR hyperintensity in the high right anterior frontal
lobe on series 3 image 19.  There is an overlying craniotomy defect in
this region.  Major intracranial flow voids are grossly maintained.
There is no evidence of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarct.
No evidence of new parenchymal hemorrhage.  No gross abnormality of the
sella.  The basilar cisterns are patent.
 
After contrast administration, there is some dural thickening and
enhancement subjacent to the craniotomy and associated with the right
cerebral hemispheric extra-axial collection.  There may be mild
leptomeningeal enhancement in the right hemisphere is well for example
on series 7 image 17 although this is not definitive and could be
related to vascular engorgement. No new intracranial enhancement
otherwise.
 
Soft tissue thickening and enhancement overlying the craniotomy
extending into the right temporal scalp region is similar and could
potentially represent a flap reconstruction.  No gross orbital
abnormalities.  Mild paranasal sinus mucosal thickening.  Right mastoid
effusion.  Left mastoid air cells are clear.
 
Previously described at scalp lesion with calvarial erosion in the left
parietal vertex is unchanged.
 
 
 
IMPRESSION:
 
Motion degraded study.
 
Postoperative changes of right frontal craniotomy.  Extra-axial
collection over the right lateral cerebral convexity presumably
represents subdural hemorrhage.  Dural thickening and enhancement
subjacent to the craniotomy and associated with the subdural hemorrhage
is not entirely unexpected.  However, there is question of a
leptomeningeal enhancement in the right cerebral hemisphere (although
this could be related to vascular engorgement secondary to the subdural
hemorrhage).  Furthermore, new ill-defined FLAIR hyperintensity in the
high right frontal region is present (without corresponding diffusion
abnormality to suggest infarct or associated parenchymal enhancement to
suggest metastasis).  CSF analysis may be helpful to exclude an
infiltrating leptomeningeal process such as infection or neoplasm.
 
Similar appearance of lesion in the left parietal scalp with calvarial
erosion, concerning for a neoplasm.

MRI OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH GADOLINIUM ENHANCEMENT.
 
CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Right lower quadrant abdominal pain radiating to the ribs.
 
TECHNIQUE:
Multiplanar multisequence imaging data were acquired through the
abdominal viscera before and after administration of gadolinium agent.
The patient received 13 ml MultiHance agent without reported adverse
event.
 
COMPARISON:
Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis obtained April 12, 2018.
 
FINDINGS:
Limited imaging of the lung bases reveals no significant pulmonary or
pleural abnormality.  Breast implants appear intact in the field of
view.
 
The liver is mildly enlarged with craniocaudal span 19.6 cm.  It has
normal contours and echogenicity, with no biliary ductal dilation.  A
punctate cyst is present in the inferior right lobe.  The gallbladder
is moderately filled, but no calculus or wall thickening is present.
No intraductal calculus is present.  The spleen, pancreas, adrenal
glands, kidneys, and (within motion limitations) the abdominal GI tract
appear normal. There is no free fluid.  A left para-aortic lymph node
is borderline enlarged, 11 x 11 mm. The appendix is not imaged in this
abdomen study.
 
Following administration of intravenous gadolinium agent there is
inhomogeneous enhancement in the liver without focal mass.  Elsewhere
enhancement is normal.
 
Bone marrow of the imaged thoracolumbar spine has no significant
abnormality.
 
ASSESSMENT:
1.  Hepatomegaly, with no significant focal abnormality superimposed.
2.  One nonspecific borderline enlarged retroperitoneal lymph node.
This may simply be reactive.

BILATERAL LOWER-EXTREMITY ARTERIAL SONOGRAM.
 
CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Decreased pulses and cyanosis in the lower extremities.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Real-time high-resolution grey-scale and color/spectral
Doppler sonographic evaluation of the major arteries of the lower
extremities.  Ankle-brachial indices were attempted but lower extremity
pressures could not be obtained.
 
COMPARISON:
There is no prior arterial sonogram at this facility.
 
FINDINGS:
Image quality is overall adequate.
 
Right:
The following sonographic arterial data and peak systolic velocities
were acquired.
   External iliac: Plaque less than 20%.  Biphasic at 49 cm/sec PSV.
   Common femoral:  Plaque less than 20%.  Biphasic at 57 cm/sec PSV.
   Deep femoral:  widely patent.
   Superficial femoral:
      Proximal:  Plaque less than 10%.  Triphasic at 50 cm/sec PSV.
      Middle:  Plaque near 30%.  Minimally triphasic at 66 cm/sec PSV.
      Distal:  Plaque less than 30%.  Triphasic at 158 cm/sec PSV.
   Popliteal:  Plaque less than 20%.  Minimally triphasic at 32 cm/sec
PSV.
   Peroneal:  Moderate caliber, minimal plaque.  Triphasic at 41 cm/sec
PSV.
   Posterior tibial:  Small caliber, minimally triphasic at 22 cm/sec
PSV.
   Dorsalis pedis:  Small caliber, monophasic at 30 cm/sec PSV.
 
Left:
The following sonographic arterial data and peak systolic velocities
were acquired.
   External iliac:  Plaque less than 10%.  Triphasic at 60 cm/sec PSV.
   Common femoral:  Plaque less than 20%.  Triphasic at 50 cm/sec PSV.
   Deep femoral:  Widely patent.
   Superficial femoral:
      Proximal:  Plaque less than 20%.  Triphasic at 51 cm/sec PSV.
      Middle:  Plaque less than 20%.  Triphasic at 41 cm/sec PSV.
      Distal:  Obscured.  Minimally biphasic at 37 cm/sec PSV.
   Popliteal:  Plaque less than 30%, somewhat obscured.  Monophasic at
23 cm/sec PSV.
   Peroneal:  Large caliber, minimal plaque.  Triphasic at 46 cm/sec
PSV.
   Posterior tibial:  Small caliber, monophasic at 28 cm/sec PSV.
   Dorsalis pedis artery:  Small caliber, monophasic at 15 cm/sec PSV.
 
ASSESSMENT:
Arterial velocities and waveforms are degraded essentially throughout
both lower extremities, raising the possibility of a more proximal
stenosis (in the aorta or the common iliac arteries).  No focal
occlusion is present in the lower extremities.  The runoff vessels have
very low velocities and wave forms.

COMPARISON:  Head CT dated 04/13/2018.  Brain MRI dated 03/05/2017.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar MRI of the brain was performed before and after
the administration of 17 ml Multihance IV contrast.
 
FINDINGS:
There is no evidence of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarct.
 
The brain parenchyma again shows scattered nonspecific FLAIR
hyperintensities.  A few of these are more conspicuous than on prior
particularly in the high frontal lobes for example on series 4 image
20.  No mass effect or midline shift.  No abnormal extra-axial fluid
collections.  Major intracranial flow voids are grossly maintained.  No
evidence of parenchymal hemorrhage.  No gross abnormality of the sella.
The basilar cisterns are patent.
 
After contrast administration, there is a developmental venous anomaly
in the right peri sylvian region.  No other abnormal enhancement.
 
No gross orbital abnormalities.  Mild paranasal sinus mucosal
thickening.  Mastoid air cells are clear.
 
IMPRESSION:
No acute infarct.
 
Scattered nonspecific parenchymal FLAIR hyperintensities.  While they
could be related to the provided history of multiple sclerosis, they
are not specific for this and other etiologies could be considered
including accelerated microvascular ischemic change (especially if the
patient has appropriate risk factors), sequelae of vasculitis, or
migraine headaches.  Please clinically correlate.
 
Please note that a history of optic neuritis is provided.  Dedicated
orbit protocol MRI was not performed.  This could be performed if
clinically indicated.

INDICATION: ams
 
TECHNIQUE:  FCT 0042T CT STROKE PERFUSION - CT scanning of the head was
performed without contrast.  CT arteriogram of the head and neck was
then performed using axial 0.625 mm sections, reformatted in coronal
and sagittal planes.  3D surface and/or MIP rendering performed.
 
Any cervical carotid luminal stenosis given is relative to distal
normal lumen vessel diameter as per our standard practice (NASCET
criteria). Individualized dose optimization technique was used for the
procedure performed.  100 ml Visipaque 320 administered intravenously.
 
COMPARISON:  CT of the brain 12/21/2017
 
FINDINGS:
There is a large right parietal hematoma measuring approximately 7 cm.
There is associated edema surrounding this hemorrhage with mild
leftward midline shift measuring approximately 6 mm, partial effacement
of the right lateral ventricle, and mild bilateral intraventricular
hemorrhage layering within the occipital horns.  There is no
hydrocephalus.  An age indeterminate infarct is seen within the right
thalamus.  Borderline low lying cerebellar tonsils, however the foramen
magnum appears patent.  There is minimal mass effect on the third
ventricle. Ill-defined age indeterminate lucency within the left
parietal lobe possibly representing an age indeterminate infarct versus
focal white matter disease.
 
CT angiogram of the neck demonstrates a normal caliber aorta with some
atherosclerotic calcifications.  The innominate and subclavian arteries
appear patent with some atherosclerotic calcification of the left
subclavian artery.  Severe stenosis of the left vertebral artery origin
due to atherosclerotic plaque.  Mild stenosis of the right vertebral
artery origin due to atherosclerotic plaque.  There is a retrotracheal
course of the right vertebral artery.  Atherosclerotic calcification of
the right carotid bifurcation is present with approximately 75%
stenosis of the Right ICA origin due to calcific atherosclerotic
plaque.  Mild atherosclerotic calcification of the left carotid
bifurcation with less than 25% stenosis of the left ICA origin due to
atherosclerotic plaque.
 
Intracranially, there are atherosclerotic calcifications of the the
carotid siphons.  2 mm leftward directed  anterior communicating artery
aneurysm. No large vessel occlusion or significant stenosis.
 
On postcontrast imaging there is extensive active extravasation of
contrast material into the hematoma compatible with active bleeding.
 
Some interstitial thickening within the lung apices.  Probable
secretions within the upper trachea.  Small nodular region within the
left vallecula is nonspecific and may represent small vallecular cyst.
 
Multilevel degenerative changes of the spine.  No acute osseous
abnormality.  No aggressive osseous lesion osteopenia.  Retrolisthesis
of C4 on C5.  Grade 1 anterolisthesis of C3 and C4.
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  Large right parietal hematoma with extensive active extravasation.
Local mass effect, surrounding edema, and mild leftward midline shift.
Preliminary report was communicated to Dr. Haji by the CT technologist
at the time of these scan.
2.  Approximately 75% stenosis right internal carotid artery origin.
3.  Anterior communicating artery aneurysm measuring 2 mm.
4.  Possible age indeterminate infarcts within the right thalamus and
left parietal lobe

INDICATION(S):  Right upper quadrant abdominal pain
 
TECHNIQUE:  CT scanning of the abdomen and pelvis was performed without
intravenous contrast.  Individualized dose optimization technique was
utilized for this procedure.
 
FINDING(S):  The patient has a history of tricuspid valve surgery and
the current examination shows an element of cardiomegaly.  The inferior
vena cava is notably dilated.  However, the liver is normal in
appearance without focal pathology.  The wall of the gallbladder is
somewhat indistinct and may be inflamed.  In addition, there is some
questionable thickening of the wall of the second and third portions of
the duodenum with some adjacent mesenteric thickening.  Evaluation of
the pancreas is somewhat limited, in part due to the lack of oral or
intravenous contrast.  There is some stranding in the mesentery
anteriorly as well.  The appendix is notably normal.  The spleen is
normal as are both adrenals and kidneys.  The patient notably has a
trace of free fluid in the dependent portion of the pelvis.  No pelvic
mass lesions are seen and there is no lymphadenopathy.  The patient
does have a 2 cm cyst on the left ovary which is probably a follicle.
 
IMPRESSION(S):  The gallbladder wall appears somewhat thickened and
indistinct as does the wall of the second and third portions of the
duodenum with mesenteric stranding in the anterior superior abdomen.
The findings raise the possibility of duodenitis or peptic ulcer
disease.  There is no free intraperitoneal air.  Pancreatitis is also a
consideration but the pancreas is indistinct and somewhat difficult to
visualize.  The patient does have a trace of free fluid in the pelvis.
 
The patient has a known history of cardiac valvular disease and now
exhibits dilatation of the inferior vena cava with cardiomegaly.  She
has undergone a previous sternotomy procedure.  The appendix is grossly
normal.

sign was elicited The spleen is enlarged with craniocaudal span 14.2
cm, transverse thickness 5.9 cm, and transverse long axis 14.1 cm.  No
ascites is visible.
 
ASSESSMENT:
1.  The liver is enlarged and echogenic consistent with steatosis.
Splenomegaly is present as well.
2.  The gallbladder is edematous but there is no cholelithiasis and
there is no ductal dilation. No sonographic Murphy's sign was elicited,
making cholecystitis even less likely. Considerations would include
hypoproteinemia, portal hypertension (cirrhosis), or acalculous
cholecystitis.  If there is concern for acute ductal obstruction then
hepatobiliary scintigraphy might be helpful.

CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE CHEST.
 
CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Chest pain, tachycardia, and dyspnea.
 
TECHNIQUE:
Helical CT data were acquired through the chest, from the thoracic
inlet through the upper abdomen, during pulmonary artery enhancement.
Data were reconstructed into thin axial images.  Sagittal, coronal, and
bilateral coronal oblique reconstructions were obtained.  The patient
received 100 ml Omnipaque-300 without reported adverse event.
Individualized dose-optimization technique was utilized for the
procedure performed.
 
COMPARISON:
There is no relevant prior study at this facility.
 
FINDINGS:
Contrast opacification of the pulmonary arteries is adequate though
suboptimal.  These arteries are normal caliber without intraluminal
thrombus.  Contrast opacification of the thoracic aorta is adequate to
exclude an acute aortic process.  Heart size normal.  There is no
pericardial effusion.
 
The lungs have normal volume with mild dependent atelectasis but no
consolidation, edema, or effusion.  The central airways are widely
patent.  There is no lymphadenopathy.
 
Limited imaging of the upper abdomen reveals no acute abnormality.  The
adrenal glands are incompletely imaged, but included parts of these
appear normal.
 
No significant osseous abnormality is present.
 
ASSESSMENT:
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.  No significant pulmonary or
pleural abnormality.
2.  Mild edema in the distal esophagus perhaps reflecting esophagitis.

FINDINGS:
  There are regions of low attenuation in the perventricular white
matter that most likely represent chronic small vessel ischemic change
and age related atrophy.  This process and limitations of NONcontract
head CT makes evaluation of acute ischemia suboptimal.  Further imaging
can be performed as needed. Small old infarctions near the basil
ganglia.
  No acute hemorrhage. Mild sinus disease. No acute fracture.
 
 
IMPRESSION:
No acute process.

HEAD CT WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST
 
INDICATION:  Follow up abnormal head CT.  Lung cancer.  Evaluate for
metastatic disease.
 
COMPARISON:  None available.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Routine axial CT imaging of the brain was performed before
and after administration of 100 ml Omnipaque-300 IV contrast.
 
FINDINGS:
In the posterior right parietal lobe there is an enhancing mass
measuring up to 2.2 cm maximum dimension with adjacent edema. There is
some hyperattenuation associated with the mass on noncontrast images
probably due to hypercellularity although a hemorrhagic component is
not excluded. The edema causes mass effect upon the posterior aspect of
the right lateral ventricle.
 
No acute hemorrhage elsewhere.  No midline shift.  Global volume loss
with associated ventricular dilatation. Patchy periventricular
hypoattenuation without loss of gray-white differentiation otherwise.
No other enhancing mass lesions.
 
 
Bilateral cataract surgery.  Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid
air cells are clear.
 
IMPRESSION:
2.2 cm enhancing mass in the right parietal lobe, probably representing
a metastatic lesion.  Consider brain MRI to further evaluate.

FINDINGS: The heart size and pulmonary vascularity are normal.  There
is volume loss in the right lung with surgical sutures in the right
upper lobe and over the right hilar region. A triangular area of
opacity is present at the right lung base with associated right
costophrenic angle blunting.  The recent CT scan 04/09/2018
demonstrated a small right-sided pleural effusion and a smaller
left-sided effusion. Known osteoblastic metastases in the spine not
well seen on plain film radiograph.
 
IMPRESSION: Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
The triangular opacity at the right lung base is probably related to
the pleural effusion and/or pleural thickening.  A similar
configuration was seen on prior exam 05/28/2015.

BILATERAL LOWER-EXTREMITY VENOUS SONOGRAM.
 
CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Previous DVT.
 
TECHNIQUE:
Real-time high-resolution grey-scale and color/spectral Doppler
sonographic evaluation of the major veins of the lower extremities,
from the common femoral veins to the posterior tibial veins, evaluating
response to compression and other techniques.
 
COMPARISON:
Venous sonogram obtained April 7, 2018.
 
FINDINGS:
Image quality is overall good. The imaged veins of the right lower
extremity are patent and compressible, with normal spectral
variability.  On the left, the common femoral, greater saphenous, and
cranial and middle segments of the femoral veins are patent and
compressible.  An immobilizer obscures the rest of the veins from the
caudal femoral vein through the ankle.
 
ASSESSMENT:
No evidence of DVT in the right lower extremity, or in the left lower
extremity to the midportion of the femoral vein.  The caudal veins of
the left lower extremity are not visible because the patient is in an
immobilizer. The presence of residual thrombus in that region is thus
not evaluated.

EXAM: LCT ABD/PELVIS WO CONTRAST
 
HISTORY: L abd pain, Alzhiemers
 
TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast enhanced transaxial images of the abdomen and
pelvis were acquired from the lung bases to the symphysis pubis.
 
COMPARISON: None
 
FINDINGS: Exam is limited by lack of IV contrast. The study is also
degraded by motion artifacts.
 
There are small bilateral pleural effusions at the lung bases, left
greater than right. Opacities at the left lung base probably represent
atelectasis rather than active infiltrate. Coronary artery
calcifications are noted over the heart.
 
The liver,  pancreas, and gallbladder are unremarkable. Calcified
granulomas are noted in the spleen. The right adrenal glands
unremarkable.  There is nonspecific mild thickening of the left adrenal
gland.
 
The bowel gas pattern is nonobstructive . The stomach and small bowel
are unremarkable. There is a small hiatal hernia. There are a few small
air-fluid levels within the colon. There are scattered small
diverticula without evidence of acute diverticulitis.
 
The kidneys are normal size.  No masses, calculus, or hydronephrosis is
present.
 
There is no pathological adenopathy in the abdomen or pelvis. There are
no focal inflammatory changes.
 
The appendix is visualized and has a normal appearance. There are
motion artifacts present in the abdomen at the level of the appendix
and cecum. Increased density in the mesentery at this level is probably
related to motion artifact.
 
The urinary bladder is not well distended but the urinary bladder wall
appears thickened.  There is a small focus of air within the urinary
bladder.
 
The prostate gland and seminal vesicles are unremarkable .
 
The abdominal aorta demonstrates atherosclerotic disease without
evidence of aneurysm.
 
No suspicious osseous lesions are identified. Multilevel degenerative
changes are present within the thoracic and lumbar spine peri there are
compression deformities of L1 and L2. The paravertebral soft tissues at
these levels are normal.  The findings suggest chronic compression
fractures.
 
IMPRESSION:
 
1. Small bilateral pleural effusions at the lung bases.  Opacity at the
left lung base probably atelectasis but clinical correlation is
recommended to exclude active infiltrate.
2. Nonobstructive bowel gas pattern.  Small air-fluid levels are noted
in the colon. Findings may represent enteritis.  There are scattered
diverticula without evidence of acute diverticulitis.
3. There is thickening of the urinary bladder wall and small focus of
air in the urinary bladder.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
4. Compression deformities of L1 and L2 indeterminate age.  These are
likely chronic but correlation with symptoms is recommended to exclude
acute compression fractures.

MRI OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT AND WITH GADOLINIUM ENHANCEMENT.
 
CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Abnormal signal characteristics in the sacrum in a recent lumbar spine
MRI.
 
TECHNIQUE:
Multiplanar multisequenc imaging data were acquired through the pelvis
before and after administration of gadolinium agent.  The patient
received 20 ml ProHance without reported adverse event.
 
COMPARISON:
Lumbar spine MRI obtained April 12, 2018.  CT of the abdomen and pelvis
obtained January 17, 2018.
 
FINDINGS:
There is moderate edema in the left sacral ala at S1 and S2, with
minimal edema on the iliac side of the sacroiliac joint as well.  There
is no visible disruption of the joint surfaces.  There is mild edema in
the right S1 sacral ala and minimal edema at S2 there.  Minimal edema,
again, is present at the iliac side of the joint without visible joint
destruction.
 
There is severe edema in the pubic bones and parasymphyseal pubic rami,
superior worse than inferior.  There is moderate fluid within the pubic
symphysis joint itself.
 
No edema is present in the caudal sacrum and the coccyx.
 
There is rather diffuse but mild edema in the pelvic musculature,
involving the right gluteus maximus, the obturator musculature, and the
small adductors of the hips, as well as the caudal parts of the
iliopsoas muscle bilaterally.
 
Limited imaging of internal pelvic viscera reveals bilateral renal
cysts with, larger on the left but incompletely imaged.  Small-volume
free fluid is present in the pelvis.  A left inguinal hernia contains
fat.  No lymphadenopathy is visible. The urinary bladder is largely
collapsed, with a Foley catheter.
 
Following administration of intravenous gadolinium agent, the edematous
parts of the sacrum and the iliac bones enhance.  Again no visible
cortical destruction is evident.  There is severe enhancement in the
pubic bones, and surrounding the joint fluid.  There is no enhancement
in the caudal sacrum and the coccyx.
 
ASSESSMENT:
Multifocal edema and enhancement is present:
A.  In the left S1 and S2 sacral ala, and at the iliac side of the
sacroiliac joint there.
B.  In the right S1 sacral ala, and at the iliac side of the sacroiliac
joint there.
C.  At the pubic symphysis, the pubic bones, and the pubic rami, with a
symphysial effusion.
D.  At multiple sites in the pelvic musculature, as above.
Given the multifocal nature of these lesions, and the absence of
discrete discrete osseous destruction, these all
may represent individual sites of subacute fracture and associated
myositis or muscle injury. Of course, correlation is recommended for
physical signs and symptoms of osteomyelitis which may merit additional
evaluation.

CONTRAST-ENHANCED CT OF THE ABDOMEN.
CONTRAST-ENHANCED CT OF THE PELVIS.
 
CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Periumbilical abdominal pain.  Recent hernia repair surgery.
 
TECHNIQUE:
Helical CT data were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis, from the
lung bases through the pubic symphysis, after administration of
intravenous contrast material; no additional delayed data were
acquired.  Data were reconstructed into thin axial images.  Sagittal
and coronal reconstructions were obtained.  The patient received 100 ml
Omnipaque-300 without reported adverse event.  Individualized
dose-optimization technique was utilized for the procedure performed.
 
COMPARISON:
There is no relevant prior study at this facility.
 
FINDINGS:
L5 is sacralized.  Moderate to severe disc degenerative change is
present at L4-5.  There is no destructive or blastic bone lesion.
 
Abdomen:
Limited imaging of the lung bases reveals mild dependent atelectasis,
with no effusion or consolidation.
 
Mild patient motion blurs the central abdomen.  The spleen is upper
normal size.  The liver, pancreas, and gallbladder, kidneys, adrenal
glands, and abdominal GI tract appear normal within this limitation.
There is no free fluid or lymphadenopathy.  Mild aortoiliac vascular
calcification is notable in this 38-year-old patient.  Small-volume gas
bubbles are present at the deep margin of the anterior body wall,
reflecting recent prior surgery.  There is edema in the right
periumbilical tissues, and minimal edema is present near midline in the
infraumbilical subcutaneous fat; but no fluid collection is present
there or elsewhere.  There is no lymphadenopathy.
 
Pelvis:
The urinary bladder is collapsed with no visible abnormality.  The
prostate gland is not enlarged.  The colon has diffuse mild edema.  The
appendix appears normal. Confined fluid is present in the caudal
inguinal canal on each side, 31 x 27 mm on the right and 18 x 15 mm on
the left.  These are not thick-walled and they do not contain gas.
Strandy edema is present at the internal ring bilaterally.  No pelvic
lymphadenopathy is present.
 
ASSESSMENT:
1.  Right periumbilical subcutaneous edema; infraumbilical subcutaneous
edema; and anterior body wall gas bubbles reflect previous surgery.
There is no defined collection in this region.
2.  Strandy fluid is present at the inguinal internal ring bilaterally,
likely reflecting recent surgery.  Confined fluid is present more
caudally in each inguinal canal, but this is not thick-walled and it
does not contain gas.
3.  The colon appears mildly edematous, consistent with a mild colitis.
4.  Mild aortoiliac vascular calcification is notable in this
38-year-old patient.

HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST
 
INDICATION:  fall
 
COMPARISON:  None available.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Routine CT imaging of the brain was performed without IV
contrast.
 
FINDINGS:
There is no convincing evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Questionable minimal hyperattenuation in the left occipital horn on
axial image 17 is felt to be due to the artifact rather than tiny
volume of hemorrhage.  No midline shift or abnormal extra-axial fluid
collections.  Global volume loss with associated ventricular
dilatation.  Minimal periventricular hypoattenuation.  Gray-white
differentiation is maintained. Basilar cisterns are patent.
 
Bilateral cataract surgery.  Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid
air cells are clear.  Atherosclerosis.
 
IMPRESSION:
No definite acute intracranial abnormality.  Artifact more likely than
tiny volume intraventricular hemorrhage.  If symptoms persist consider
short-term follow-up head CT.

Admitting DX: ACUTE LOWER BACK PAIN
Working DX: ACUTE LOWER BACK PAIN
 

INDICATION: 53-year-old male with right back pain/hypertension.  No
cancer history.  Nonsmoker.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Individualized dose optimization technique was used for
this procedure. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis performed axially
without contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformatted images of the
abdomen, pelvis, and lumbar spine are provided.
 
COMPARISON:  No relevant recent prior study.
 
FINDINGS:
Diffuse hypoattenuation of the hepatic parenchyma relative to the
spleen is present, consistent with fatty liver. The gallbladder,
pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are normal in appearance.  No
hiatal hernia is present. The abdominal aorta is of normal caliber. A
fat-containing small umbilical hernia is present. No hydronephrosis or
obstructing ureteral calculus is present.
 
The appendix is normal in appearance. A fat-containing right inguinal
hernia is present. There is question of asymmetric wall thickening
present along the rectum. This appearance may be due to incomplete
distension, however, proctitis or infiltrating lesion cannot be
excluded. No abdominal pelvic adenopathy is present. No bowel
obstruction or pneumoperitoneum is present.
 
No acute fracture is present.  Degenerative disc disease changes are
present at L3-L4 through L5-S1. Degenerative endplate sclerosis is
present at L5-S1.
 
L3-L4:  A posterior disc bulge is present which contains a superimposed
left paracentral disc protrusion.  Additionally, there is a
superimposed right paracentral disc extrusion which migrates inferiorly
along the right posterolateral aspect of the L4 vertebral body to the
L4 pedicular level. This results in mild to moderate central canal
narrowing and mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing.
 
L4-L5: A posterior disc bulge, ligamentum flavum thickening, and facet
arthropathy are present, contributing to mild to moderate bilateral
neural foraminal narrowing and mild to moderate central canal narrowing.
 
L5-S1: A posterior disc osteophyte complex and facet arthropathy
contribute to moderate right neural foraminal narrowing, mild to
moderate left neural foraminal narrowing, and mild to moderate central
canal narrowing.
 
Impression:
1.  Hepatosteatosis.
2.  Fat-containing umbilical hernia.  Fat-containing right inguinal
hernia.
3.  Question of asymmetric wall thickening, in appearance which may be
simply due to incomplete distension,
however, proctitis or infiltrative lesion cannot be excluded. No bowel
obstruction.
4. Degenerative changes of the lumbar spine at L3-L4 through L5-S1, as
described in detail above.

COMPARISON:  December 19, 2017
 
FINDINGS:  There is mild to moderate prominence of the ventricular
system and sulci consistent with atrophy.  Moderate hypodensity seen
bilaterally within the white matter which is nonspecific but most
likely related to chronic microvascular ischemic changes.  This appears
unchanged from previous exam. Old lacunar infarcts are seen in the
right basal ganglia and thalamus unchanged from prior study.
Encephalomalacia within the inferior frontal lobes greater on the left
near midline appears unchanged from prior study.  There is no evidence
of acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect or midline shift.  The
calvarium appears intact.  The visualized paranasal sinuses are clear
except for a mucus retention cyst or polyp in the right maxillary
sinus.  The mastoid air cells are clear.
 
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  No acute intracranial findings.
2.  Atrophy and chronic microvascular ischemic changes.  Old lacunar
infarcts in the right basal ganglia and thalamus.  Stable
encephalomalacia possibly relating to remote trauma within the inferior
aspects of the bilateral frontal lobe.
 
MRI is more sensitive for the detection of acute to subacute infarct.
A negative head CT does not rule out acute infarct.

CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Abdominal pain for several months.
 
TECHNIQUE:
Helical CT data were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis, from the
lung bases through the pubic symphysis, after administration of
intravenous contrast material; no additional delayed data were
acquired.  Data were reconstructed into thin axial images.  Sagittal
and coronal reconstructions were obtained.  The patient received 100 ml
Omnipaque-300 without reported adverse event.  Individualized
dose-optimization technique was utilized for the procedure performed.
 
COMPARISON:
There is no relevant prior study at this facility.
 
FINDINGS:
No significant osseous abnormality is present.
 
Abdomen:
Limited imaging of the lung bases reveals no significant pulmonary or
pleural abnormality.
 
The liver, spleen, pancreas, gallbladder, adrenal glands,
contrast-opacified abdominal GI tract, and left kidney appear normal.
The right kidney has two small cysts in its lower pole.  There is no
lymphadenopathy or free fluid.
 
Pelvis:
The urinary bladder appears normal.  The uterus is anteverted with
normal contours.  The ovaries and adnexa appear normal with a
physiologic-sized peripherally-enhancing cyst or follicle on the left.
The colon and the appendix appear normal.  There is no lymphadenopathy,
and trace free fluid is within physiologic volume range.
 
ASSESSMENT:
Physiologic changes in the pelvis.  No evidence of an acute abdominal
process.

HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST
 
INDICATION:  slurred speech, facial weakness
 
COMPARISON:  None available.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Routine CT imaging of the brain was performed without IV
contrast.
 
FINDINGS:
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.  No midline
shift.  Global volume loss with associated ventricular dilatation.  An
area of encephalomalacia is in the high right frontal lobe most
compatible with an old infarct.  There are also areas of
hypoattenuation in the basal ganglia and right thalamus likely
representing remote infarcts.  No loss of gray-white differentiation
otherwise.  The basilar cisterns are patent.  There is some
dolichoectasia of the posterior circulation with question of a basilar
tip aneurysm.  There also is question of an aneurysm at the left MCA
trifurcation on image 8.
 
No gross orbital abnormalities.  The visualized paranasal sinuses and
mastoid air cells are clear.
 
IMPRESSION:
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
 
Multifocal presumed remote infarcts.  Global volume loss with presumed
chronic microvascular ischemic changes.  It is difficult to exclude
acute ischemic change however without the benefit of a prior study for
direct comparison. If there is continued clinical concern for acute
ischemic change, consider MRI to further evaluate.
 
 
Question of aneurysms of particularly in the region of the basilar tip
and left MCA trifurcation.  MRA or CTA could be performed to further
evaluate this as well.

TECHNIQUE: Multiple noncontrast CT images of the head were obtained.
Individualized dose optimalization was used.
 
FINDINGS:
  There are regions of low attenuation in the perventricular white
matter that most likely represent chronic small vessel ischemic change
and age related atrophy.  This process and limitations of NONcontract
head CT makes evaluation of acute ischemia suboptimal.  Further imaging
can be performed as needed.
  No acute hemorrhage. Mild sinus disease. No acute fracture.

images obtained of the bilateral kidneys and associated vasculature as
well as the central retroperitoneum/aorta with a multifrequency sector
transducer.
 
COMPARISON:  MRA 04/13/2018
 
FINDINGS:  There is abnormal high velocity in what appears to be the
the left renal artery at its origin, up to 342 cm/sec. Renal to aortic
ratio is greater than three.
 
On the right, the solid velocity 152 cm per sec.
 
Renal veins are patent.

way of parvus-tardus configuration.
 
Right kidney measures 8.7 cm length, left kidney 8.3 cm.  2.1 cm cyst
in the superior pole right kidney.
 
IMPRESSION:  Elevated peak systolic velocity in the left renal artery
near its origin.  Suspect clinically significant stenosis. Given
history, consider correlation with pressures obtained at catheter-based
angiography, perhaps at the time of/immediately prior to potential
intervention.

of age and status post cholecystectomy.  Kidneys appear unremarkable.
 
There seems to be subtle thickening to the wall of the large intestine
beginning at the splenic flexure and extending down the descending
colon perhaps into the rectosigmoid as well.  Cannot exclude some sort
of active colitis.  Visible GI tract reveals no obstruction or other
definite acute inflammatory change.  No abscess.  Appendix difficult to
perceive, but no pericecal stranding noted right lower quadrant.  I see
no ventral or hiatal hernia.  No pneumatosis or portal venous gas or

EXAMINATION:  CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST,  04/14/2018
 
INDICATION: 79-year-old M with given reason for exam of "new onset
acute pancreatitis based on labs with severely elevated lipase, eval
for secondary causes".
 
TECHNIQUE:  CT imaging obtained of the abdomen and pelvis from the lung
bases through the ischium following intravenous administration of 70 ml
Omnipaque-300 iodinated contrast media.  Multiplanar 2-D reformations
performed.  Individualized radiation dose reduction techniques were
used.
 
COMPARISON:  08/01/2014
 
FINDINGS:  The lowermost chest reveals a borderline sized heart.  Heavy
mitral annulus mineralization noted.  Some calcification seen in the
aortic valve plane and there is some coronary calcific atherosclerotic
plaque as well.  Extreme lung bases show mild subpleural reticular
scarring.  No effusion evident in the region.
 
In the abdomen, gallbladder remains in place with equivocal gallbladder
wall thickening/hyperenhancement.  The liver may be slightly diffusely
hypoattenuating, fatty infiltration not excluded.  Spleen size is
normal.  There is no adrenal mass.  Kidneys show mild atrophy.  Benign
cyst left kidney up to 3.6 cm.
 
I see no upper abdominal, retroperitoneal or mesenteric adenopathy.
 
The pancreas margin is slightly indistinct, though not itself
necessarily strongly indicative of pancreatitis.  No pancreatic
parenchymal necrosis or peripancreatic fluid collection noted.  I see
no evidence of adjacent splenic or portal vein or superior mesenteric
vein thrombosis.
 
There is moderate calcific atherosclerotic plaque abdominal aorta but
no AAA.
 
Visible GI tract reveals no obstruction or acute inflammatory change
otherwise. Normal appendix seen right lower quadrant.  There is no
ventral or hiatal hernia.  The
 
In the pelvis, urinary bladder rather full.  Prostate appears at least
mildly enlarged.  Seminal vesicles appear symmetric.  No pelvic
adenopathy or pelvic hernia notable of any concern.  There is a small
indirect right inguinal fatty hernia without inflammation or
involvement of bowel.
 
Visible osseous structures reveal some degenerative changes but no
acute or aggressive process.
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  Pancreas may be slightly indistinct.  This is far from specific and
could be in the normal range but not inconsistent with given history of
active pancreatitis.  Either way, no pancreatic parenchymal necrosis,
peripancreatic fluid collection or associated venous thrombosis
appreciable.  Additionally, no obvious dilatation noted of the
pancreatic or biliary ductal tree.
2.  Questionable thickening to the gallbladder wall, cholecystitis not
excluded.
3.  Question mild fatty infiltration liver.
4.  Aortic atherosclerosis but no AAA.
5.  Benign left renal cyst.
6.  Mild distension urinary bladder but no hydronephrosis.

multifrequency sector transducer.  Gray-scale and limited color-flow
imaging performed.
 
COMPARISON:  CT 04/14/2018
 
FINDINGS:  Liver is somewhat echogenic with difficulty in sonographic
penetration, more evidence of fatty infiltration.  Again no biliary
ductal dilatation seen, with common duct only 3 mm in diameter.  Portal
vein is patent with appropriate antegrade/hepatopetal flow.
 
Gallbladder does reveal some wall thickening between six and 7 mm.
There may be some intramural edema as well. Positive sonographic
Murphy's sign. Findings suspicious for acute acalculous cholecystitis.
 
The right kidney measures 12.2 cm length, left kidney measures 12 cm.
Benign cyst again notable lower pole left kidney.  No hydronephrosis.
Spleen size is normal.  Visible portion of the aorta, IVC and pancreas
appear unremarkable, with some of the central retroperitoneum obscured
by overlying bowel gas. Again no ascites noted.

COMPARISON:  Head CT/CTA dated 04/13/2018.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar MRI examination of the brain was performed
without intravenous contrast.
 
FINDINGS:
There is no evidence of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarct.
 
Prominence of the extra-axial CSF space over both posterior parietal
convexities is unchanged.  The brain parenchyma shows a few tiny
nonspecific FLAIR hyperintensities.  No mass effect or midline shift.
Major intracranial flow voids are grossly maintained.  No evidence of
parenchymal hemorrhage.  Question partially empty sella.  Basilar
cisterns are patent.  Upper cervical degenerative changes are
incompletely imaged.
 
No gross orbital abnormalities. Extensive paranasal sinus mucosal
thickening.  Mastoid air cells are clear.  The densities within the
parotid glands described on the recent head CT are incompletely
evaluated on this study.  However there is a 2.7 cm mass adjacent to
the tail of the left parotid gland on series 8 image 12.
 
IMPRESSION:
No acute intracranial abnormality.  No acute infarct.
 
Tiny FLAIR hyperintensities probably due to chronic microvascular
ischemic change.
 
2.7 cm mass adjacent to the tail of the left parotid gland.  Neoplasm
is not excluded.  Recommend further evaluation.

INDICATION:  SMD WITH HX OF ANEURYSM
 
COMPARISON:  None available.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Routine CT imaging of the brain was performed without IV
contrast.
 
FINDINGS:
There are postoperative changes of bifrontal craniotomy.  An aneurysm
clip is present along the expected course of the anterior cerebral
arteries.  Extensive adjacent parenchymal hypoattenuation presumably
reflects encephalomalacia.
 
No acute parenchymal hemorrhage.  No midline shift or abnormal
extra-axial fluid collections.  Global volume loss with associated
ventricular dilatation.  Patchy white matter hypodensities are in the
cerebral hemispheres without additional loss of gray-white
differentiation otherwise.  The basilar cisterns are patent.
 
No gross orbital abnormalities.  Visualized paranasal sinuses and
mastoid air cells are clear.  Presumed cerumen is in the external
auditory canals.  Atherosclerosis.
 
IMPRESSION:
Postoperative/post procedural changes as described above with presumed
bifrontal encephalomalacia.  No acute intracranial hemorrhage or other
definite acute intracranial abnormality.
 
Global volume loss with presumed chronic microvascular ischemic
changes.  If there is clinical concern for acute ischemic change,
consider MRI.

COMPARISON:  04/13/2018
 
FINDINGS:  The visible lowermost chest reveals normal-sized heart.
Patchy infiltrates noted in the dependent lung bases, subsegmental.
Some trace pleural fluid noted, not drainable.
 
In the abdomen, there is impressive distension throughout the colon.
Near the hepatic flexure, colon diameter up to 8 cm.  I see no evidence
of sigmoid volvulus, though the rectum is decompressed.  Previous
barium in the rectosigmoid has cleared.
 
There is new free intraperitoneal fluid, normal pelvic also in the
upper abdomen, particularly perihepatic.

TECHNIQUE:  Routine CT imaging of the neck was performed without IV
contrast.
 
FINDINGS:
A right suboccipital craniectomy defect is incompletely imaged.  No
acute abnormality in the visualized intracranial compartment.  The
visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
Parapharyngeal fat planes are grossly maintained.  The unenhanced
parotid glands are symmetric and unremarkable.  There is fatty
infiltration of the left submandibular gland.  Small calculi are in the
right submandibular gland.  No definite masslike asymmetry of the
unenhanced aerodigestive tract.  No focal thyroid abnormality. No
cervical adenopathy. Torus palatini.
 
The upper chest shows distension of the thoracic esophagus with an
air-fluid level.  A few ill-defined ground-glass opacities in the lungs.
 
Osseous degenerative changes. Prominent anterior osteophytes at C5-C6
could indent the posterior upper cervical esophagus.
 
IMPRESSION:
 
Prominent anterior osteophytes at C5-C6 could indicate the posterior
upper cervical esophagus and contribute to dysphagia.
 
The thoracic esophagus is distended with air-fluid level.  A distal
obstructing lesion of the esophagus is not excluded.  Dedicated
thoracic CT may be helpful.
 
Asymmetric fatty infiltration of the left submandibular gland.
Nonobstructing right submandibular sialoliths.

question some sort of nonspecific enteritis. Appendix seems normal size.
 
In the pelvis, mild sigmoid colon diverticulosis.  No evidence of
diverticulitis or abscess.  Uterus remains in place.  Urinary bladder
appears grossly unremarkable.  Punctate density in the midline perineum
could potentially be a calculus in the urethra, though could just as
easily be extra ureteral.  This density is similar to November 2015, so
not an acute finding, reference current series 3 image 82. Question
small/sub-centimeter periurethral cyst on image 83, right paramidline.
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  Cannot exclude mild enteritis, nonspecific.
2.  Given history, notable that I see no specific imaging findings of
pyelonephritis (or intrarenal or perinephric abscess), but
pyelonephritis is a clinical diagnosis and is not considered
definitively excluded by imaging alone.
3.  Equivocal for small ureteral calculus, though favor ensure the
urinary given stability in size and position compared with 2015. There
may be a small periurethral cyst as well.

INDICATION: DIZZY
 
TECHNIQUE:  Axial CT images are obtained without use intravenous
contrast.  Individualized dose optimization technique was used
procedure performed.  Coronal and sagittal reconstructed images were
also submitted.
 
FINDING(S):  The ventricular system and sulci appear appropriate.  The
brain appears appropriate morphology and attenuation.  Gray-white
matter differentiation appears maintained.  There is no evidence of
intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect or midline shift.  The calvarium
appears intact.  The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells
are clear.
 
 
IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial findings.
 
MRI is more sensitive for the detection of acute to subacute infarct.
A negative head CT does not rule out acute infarct.

TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar MRI evaluation of the cervical spine was
performed without IV contrast.
 
FINDINGS:
 
The study is degraded by motion.
 
Cervical spine alignment is normal.  The cervical spine vertebral
bodies are normal height and signal intensity.  Prevertebral soft
tissues are unremarkable.  No cervical cord signal abnormality is
corroborated in both imaging planes.
 
C2-C3:  The central canal and neural foramen are widely patent.
 
C3-C4:  Disc bulge with a central protrusion indents the ventral thecal
sac.  Uncovertebral hypertrophy mildly narrows the neural foramina.
 
C4-C5:  Disc bulge indents the ventral thecal sac.  Uncovertebral
hypertrophy causes mild - moderate bilateral neural foraminal stenosis.
 
C5-C6:  Disc bulge indents the ventral thecal sac.  Uncovertebral
hypertrophy moderately narrows the neural foramina.
 
C6-C7:  Uncovertebral hypertrophy may mildly narrow the neural
foramina.  The central canal is widely patent.
 
C7-T1:  The central canal and neural foramen are widely patent.
 
A left T1-T2 perineural cyst is incidentally noted.  Visualized
unenhanced soft tissue structures of the neck show no significant
abnormalities.
 
IMPRESSION:
Motion degraded study.  Mild central stenosis from C3-C4 through C5-C6.
No cord signal abnormality.  Foraminal stenosis is greatest at C4-C5
and C5-C6.

EXAM:  MRI of the thoracic spine without IV contrast
 
INDICATION:  Mid back pain.
 
COMPARISON:  None available.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar MRI examination of the thoracic spine was
performed without IV contrast.
 
FINDINGS:
 
The study is degraded by motion.
 
Thoracic spine alignment is normal.  The thoracic spine vertebral
bodies are normal height.  There is mild modic type 1 endplate change
at T9-T10.  There is also some presumed endplate change at T4-T5 and to
a lesser extent at T3-T4. No thoracic cord signal abnormality is
corroborated in both imaging planes.  Central canal and neural foramen
are widely patent throughout.
 
The visualized visceral structures show no gross abnormalities.
 
IMPRESSION:
Multilevel endplate STIR hyperintensities, presumably
degenerative/reactive in the absence of any reported trauma.  This
could be a source of pain.
 
No significant central canal narrowing.  No cord signal abnormality or
focal nerve root impingement.

EXAMINATION:  CAROTID DUPLEX DOPPLER SONOGRAPHY,  04/14/2018
 
INDICATION: 86-year-old F with given reason for study of "tia."
Amaurosis fugax.  Headache.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Static gray scale, color flow and spectral Doppler
sonographic imaging obtained of the bilateral arterial circulneck
ations in the neck, including carotids and vertebrals, with a high
frequency transducer.  Per our standard practice, the carotid arteries
are assessed by NASCET technique/criteria, unless otherwise specified.
As may be apparent below, NASCET categorization in carotid doppler is
currently primarily via peak-systolic velocity criteria (per SRU
guideline, Radiology 2003;229:340-346), with other doppler/sonographic
factors sometimes applicable to adjust categorization.
 
COMPARISON:  No relevant recent prior study.
 
FINDINGS:
Right carotid bifurcation demonstrates mild plaque.  Waveforms appear
non turbulent.
Peak systolic velocity right common carotid artery is 94 cm/s.
Peak systolic velocity right internal carotid artery is 55 cm/s.
Peak systolic velocity right external carotid artery is 74 cm/s.
 
Left carotid bifurcation demonstrates mild plaque. Waveforms appear non
turbulent.
Peak systolic velocity in the left common carotid artery is 93 cm/s.
Peak systolic velocity in the left internal carotid artery is 50 cm/s.
Peak systolic velocity in the left external carotid artery is 64 cm/s.
 
ICA/CCA peak-systolic ratio is zero point on the right and 1.1 on the
left.
 
Vertebral arteries notable for antegrade flow bilaterally, with
unremarkable waveforms.
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  At the right carotid bifurcation, mild plaque identified.  Less
than 50% severity right carotid stenosis predicted.
2.  At the left carotid bifurcation, mild plaque identified.  Less than
50% severity left carotid stenosis predicted.

EXAM:  CT of the neck with IV contrast.
 
INDICATION:  Submental swelling.
 
COMPARISON:  None
 
TECHNIQUE:  Routine CT imaging of the neck was performed with 70 ml
Omnipaque-300 IV contrast.
 
FINDINGS:
Along the right floor of mouth associated with floor of mouth
musculature there is an area of ill-defined hypoenhancement with
peripheral enhancement which measures up to approximately 1.8 x 1.4 x
1.2 cm.  There is mild adjacent fat stranding with a few prominent
lymph nodes in the immediate vicinity.  The submandibular glands are
symmetric and unremarkable.  There may be slight hyperenhancement
however of some presumed accessory salivary tissue on the right for
example on image 45.
 
The visualized intracranial compartment shows no abnormal enhancement.
Left cataract surgery.  No gross abnormality of the right orbit.  The
remainder of the visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are
clear.  Parapharyngeal fat planes are grossly maintained.  There is
some air within the both parotid ducts.  No masslike asymmetry of the
aerodigestive tract otherwise.  The thyroid shows a few small nodules.
No cervical lymphadenopathy elsewhere.
 
The upper chest shows no acute process.  Cervical spine degenerative
changes.
 
IMPRESSION:
1.8 cm ill-defined collection with peripheral enhancement perhaps with
some septations along the right floor of mouth associated with floor of
mouth musculature.  In the appropriate clinical setting this could be
due to a developing abscess.  However a neoplasm could also give this
appearance.  Adjacent inflammation and prominent nodes are presumably
related.  Please clinically correlate.  Close follow-up to ensure
resolution recommended.
 
Air within both parotid ducts of uncertain etiology.  Please correlate
with any recent procedural history.

EXAMINATION:  CT ANGIOGRAM ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH BILATERAL LOWER
EXTREMITY RUNOFF,  04/14/2018
 
INDICATION: 74-year-old F with given reason for exam of "Right lower
quadrant pain".  Right groin pain.  History of coronary stenting/artery
stenosis. Reported concern for aneurysm as well.
 
TECHNIQUE:  CT imaging obtained from the upper abdomen through the feet
during arterial phase of intravenous administration 70 ml Omnipaque-300
iodinated contrast media.  Multiplanar 2-D and 3-D reformations
performed.  Individualized radiation dose reduction techniques were
used.
 
COMPARISON:  Chest radiography 07/14/2016, CT chest 12/10/2015.
 
FINDINGS:
Vasculature -
There is moderate calcific atherosclerotic plaquing abdominal aorta but
no dissection or aneurysm in the region.  Celiac artery and superior
mesenteric arteries are patent.  Main right renal artery is patent.
Dual left renal arteries are patent.
 
Inferior mesenteric artery might be some degree than occluded at its
origin but there is distal reconstitution regardless.
 
Some stenotic disease suggested at the aortoiliac junction, with
proximal common iliac artery origin less than 1 cm bilaterally.  No
hypoattenuating clot identified.
 
Moderate long segment disease seen in the common iliac arteries as
well, left greater than right.  No pelvic aneurysm noted.  Internal and
external iliac branches are relatively only mildly involved with
atherosclerosis here.
 
In the right lower extremity, mild disease in the common femoral,
relatively normal profunda femoris.  Heavy calcific plaque in the right
superficial femoral artery proximally with at least moderate stenosis.
Superficial femoral has mild long-segment disease, mid to distal
segment. Also mild atherosclerotic plaque in the femoral tunnel region.
Moderate calcific plaque in the right popliteal artery.  Flow patent
through the trifurcation.
 
Anterior and posterior tibial arteries are patent down to the ankle as
is the peroneal though mild long-segment disease in the region.
Anterior tibial seems to taper at the level of the ankle, with only
minimal opacity in the dorsalis pedis at this time.  This could be due
to slow flow, with incomplete opacification in the region, though the
dorsalis pedis occlusion difficult to exclude.  The posterior tibial
artery does suggest a flow of these to some degree into the hind foot.
 
In the left lower extremity, moderate calcific plaque and mild stenosis
in the left common femoral, profunda femoris and proximal superficial
femoral arteries.  Mid to distal left SFA is relatively normal.  Mild
disease in the femoral tunnel junction of the femoral with the
popliteal.  Left popliteal artery is patent.  Some calcific arthrosis
at the trifurcation level extending into the peroneal artery.
Three-vessel runoff at least to the mid calf, though moderate long
segment three-vessel runoff disease here.  At least some patency
suggested to the level of the ankle, contrast:  Not well seen distally,
again cannot exclude simply slow flow versus occlusion.
 
Other Viscera -
Visible GI tract reveals no obstruction or acute inflammatory change.
No adenopathy noted. No free fluid or air seen.  Uterus remains in
place.  Urinary bladder grossly unremarkable.
 
Osseous structures reveal minimal degenerative changes at the hips and
knees, more moderate degenerative disc disease at the lumbosacral
junction and moderate lower lumbar multilevel facet arthrosis.  Mild
lumbar levoscoliosis.
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  Predominantly calcific atherosclerotic plaque distributed
throughout the aortoiliac circulation and bilateral lower extremities
as above.  Cannot exclude small vessel disease of the ankle/foot
regions but at least two- to three-vessel runoff to the ankles
bilaterally.  No arterial aneurysm evident.
2.  No other incidental chronic-appearing findings, as above.

Portable Chest
 
HISTORY: dyspnea, bibasilar crackles
 
04/14/2018 at 01:11 p.m.
 
Comparison is made to previous exam of 11/13/2016
 
A single semiupright portable chest radiograph was obtained. The nodule
in the left upper lung noted previously has enlarged in size to 2.8 cm.
Previously measured approximately 9-10 mm.  This is a significant
increase in size.  Carcinoma must be ruled out.  There is perhaps some
atelectasis in the bases.  The heart size is prominent.
 
IMPRESSION:Nodule in the left upper lung field enlarged since previous
exam.  Carcinoma must be ruled out

EXAMINATION:  CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST,  04/14/2018
 
INDICATION: 78-year-old F with given reason for exam of "enlargement of
pulmonary nodule".
 
TECHNIQUE:  CT imaging obtained from the lung apices through the lung
bases without contrast.  Multiplanar 2-D reformations performed peri
Individualized radiation dose reduction techniques were used.
 
COMPARISON:  Radiography earlier same date, prior CT 09/15/2016
 
FINDINGS:  Suspicious micro lobular and somewhat stellate mass left
upper lobe of the lung currently measured at 3.2 x 2.4 x 2 centimeters
in size, only 1 x 0.8 centimeters back in 2016.  This should be
considered bronchogenic carcinoma until proven otherwise.  No other
pulmonary nodularity evident.  Central airways in the chest appear
patent.  I see no significant mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.  No
supraclavicular adenopathy noted.  There is some asymmetry enlargement
of the right thyroid lobe as seen on previous exam with intrinsic
nodularity again approximately 2 cm in size.
 
There is calcific arthrosis in the thoracic aorta and coronary system.
No pleural or pericardial effusion noted.
 
Of benign hypoattenuating adrenal lesions are believed incidental
adenomata, similar to previous.
 
There is diffuse osteopenia if not osteoporosis.  No acute fracture
fragmentation evident.
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  Enlarging mass left upper lobe of the lung is highly suspicious
margin and should be considered bronchogenic carcinoma until proven
otherwise, significant growth since September 2016.
2.  However, no suspicious associated adenopathy or distant metastatic
disease identified in the chest or visible upper abdomen.
3.  Stable prominent right thyroid nodularity.
4.  No other more acute findings here.  No active infiltrate/pneumonia
or edema noted.  No pneumothorax or effusion.
5. Coronary and aortic calcific atherosclerosis.

Neck MRA without contrast
 
INDICATION(S):  Ataxia.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Axial 2-D time-of-flight MR angiography of the neck was
performed without contrast.  Rotational MIP reformats were constructed.
All references to stenosis are based upon NASCET criteria
 
No comparison studies are available.
 
Findings:
 
The study is degraded by motion.
 
Both common carotid arteries are patent.  There is some atherosclerotic
change at each respective carotid bifurcation with question of
approximately 50% stenosis but this could be due to in plane flow
artifact.  The extracranial internal carotid arteries are patent.
 
The left vertebral artery is dominant.  Both vertebral arteries are
patent with appropriate directional flow.
 
Impression:
 
Question of approximately 50% stenosis at both carotid bifurcations

EXAM:  MRI of the cervical spine without IV contrast
 
INDICATION:  Neck pain radiating into both arms with numbness and
tingling.
 
COMPARISON:  Cervical spine CT dated 11/18/2013.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar MRI evaluation of the cervical spine was
performed without IV contrast.
 
FINDINGS:
 
There is loss of the normal cervical lordosis with mild kyphosis
centered at C6.  There has been ACDF with plate/screw fixation and
discectomy from C3 - C6 which introduce is metallic susceptibility
artifact.  Minimal anterolisthesis of C4 on C5 and 4 mm anterolisthesis
of C5 on C6 is similar.  Vertebral body heights are maintained.  No
definite cervical cord signal abnormality.
 
C2-C3:  Uncovertebral hypertrophy may mildly narrow the left neural
foramen.  The central canal and right neural foramen are patent.
 
C3-C4:  Posterior osteophytic change indents the ventral thecal sac and
narrows the central canal to a maximum AP dimension of 7 mm.
Uncovertebral and facet hypertrophy contribute to mild - moderate
bilateral neural foraminal stenosis.
 
C4-C5:  There may be some residual disc material which indents the
ventral thecal sac and along with buckling of the ligamentum flavum
narrows the central canal to a maximum AP dimension of 7 mm.
Uncovertebral and facet hypertrophy cause moderate - severe bilateral
neural foraminal stenosis.
 
C5-C6:  Posterior osteophytic change indents the ventral thecal sac.
Uncovertebral and facet hypertrophy cause moderate - severe bilateral
neural foraminal stenosis.
 
C6-C7:  Disc bulge indents the ventral thecal sac and narrows the
central canal to a maximum AP dimension of 8 mm.  Uncovertebral
hypertrophy causes moderate - severe bilateral neural foraminal
stenosis.
 
C7-T1:  Disc bulge indents the ventral thecal sac and narrows the
central canal to a maximum AP dimension of 7 mm.  Uncovertebral and
facet hypertrophy cause severe bilateral neural foraminal stenosis.
 
The visualized unenhanced soft tissue structures of the neck show no
significant abnormalities.
 
IMPRESSION:
Postoperative changes of C3 - C6 anterior fusion as described.
 
Multilevel central stenosis most apparent at C3-C4, C4-C5, and C7-T1
although there is no definite cord signal abnormality.
 
Extensive multilevel foraminal stenosis as described, perhaps with
impingement of some of the exiting cervical nerve roots.

FINDINGS:
 
Thoracic spine alignment is normal.  The thoracic spine vertebral
bodies are normal height.  Postoperative and degenerative changes in
the cervical spine are incompletely imaged and described in greater
detail on concurrent cervical spine MRI report.
 
Disc bulge minimally indents the ventral thecal sac at multiple levels
in the thoracic spine.  There is multilevel facet arthropathy which
causes moderate - severe bilateral foraminal stenosis at T1-T2 and at
least mild - moderate multilevel foraminal stenosis at other levels.
 
The visualized visceral structures show no gross abnormalities.
 
IMPRESSION:
Incompletely imaged cervical postoperative and degenerative changes.
Please see separate cervical spine MRI report.
 
Thoracic degenerative changes.  No greater than mild central canal
narrowing.  No cord signal abnormality.  Varying degrees of thoracic
foraminal stenosis are greatest bilaterally at T1-T2.

EXAM:  MRI of the lumbar spine without IV contrast
 
INDICATION:  Low back pain radiating into both legs.
 
COMPARISON:  Lumbar CT dated 12/28/2017.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar MRI evaluation was performed without IV
contrast.
 
FINDINGS:
 
This report assumes that there are five lumbar vertebral bodies.
Lumbar spine alignment is normal.  The lumbar vertebral bodies are
normal height.  STIR hyperintensity in both L4-L5 facets is likely
degenerative/reactive.  Minimal STIR hyperintensity extends into the
adjacent pedicles.  Several intervertebral discs are desiccated.  The
conus terminates at L2-L3.
 
T12-L1:  The central canal and neural foramen are widely patent.
 
L1-L2:  There is trace disc bulge and facet hypertrophy but the central
canal and neural foramen are widely patent.
 
L2-L3:  Disc bulge indents the ventral thecal sac.  Along with facet
hypertrophy, there is mild bilateral neural foraminal stenosis.
 
L3-L4:  Disc bulge indents the ventral thecal sac and along with
facet/ligamentum flavum hypertrophy the central canal is narrowed to a
maximum AP dimension of 8 mm with partial effacement of the CSF.  Disc
material and facet hypertrophy mildly narrow the neural foramina with
approximation of the exiting L3 nerve roots.
 
L4-L5:  Disc bulge with a small central extrusion with superior
migration indents the ventral thecal sac and along with
facet/ligamentum flavum hypertrophy there is moderate to severe
circumferential central stenosis with maximum AP dimension of the
central canal measuring 6 mm.  Disc material and facet hypertrophy
moderately narrow the neural foramina with possible abutment of the
exiting L4 nerve roots.
 
L5-S1:  Posterior osteophytic change and facet hypertrophy mildly
narrow the neural foramina.  The central canal is widely patent.
 
The visualized proximal exiting sacral nerve roots are grossly
unimpinged. The visualized visceral structures show no gross
abnormalities.
 
IMPRESSION:
Degenerative changes secondary to degenerative disc disease and facet
hypertrophy.  Central stenosis is most significant at L4-L5 but quite
significant at the L3-L4 level as well.
 
Varying degrees of foraminal stenosis are greatest bilaterally L4-L5.

Individualized radiation dose reduction techniques were used.
 
COMPARISON:  At chest radiography earlier same date, MRI abdomen
12/21/2010.
 
FINDINGS:  The lungs remain fully inflated.  There is focal airspace
opacity and some of the left upper lobe of the lung, suspect
subsegmental pneumonia.  I see some non-mineralized nodularity left
lung apex posteriorly on image 11 up to approximately 4 mm in average
transaxial dimension.  Attention here on followup.  Other nodules seen
right lower lobe on image 37, 5 mm in short axis. Another seen right
upper lobe image 18, right lower lobe images 40 and 44.
 
Central airways in the chest appear patent.  I see no mediastinal or
hilar lymphadenopathy.  Heart size is normal.
 
There is calcific atherosclerotic plaque in the thoracic aorta and
coronary system.  No effusion in the chest.  No pneumothorax.
 
In the abdomen, gallbladder surgically absent.  Liver, spleen,
pancreas, adrenal glands appear unremarkable.  Kidneys reveal mild
atrophy.  Benign cyst noted right kidney, 5.3 cm in size.  There is no
hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis.
 
There is moderate abdominal aortic calcific atherosclerosis but no AAA
noted.  I see no abdominal, retroperitoneal or mesenteric adenopathy.
 
Visible GI tract reveals no obstruction or acute inflammatory change.
 
In the pelvis, evaluation inferiorly limited by beam-hardening artifact
from bilateral hip prostheses.  Urinary bladder grossly remarkable.  No
pelvic adenopathy or pelvic hernia seen.
 
Visible osseous structures reveal some degenerative change in the
spine.  I see no acute fracture fragmentation.  No aggressive
osteolysis.
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  Subtle subsegmental infiltrate/consolidative pneumonia left upper
lobe of the lung. No frank segmental or lobar consolidation.  No
pleural effusion.
2.  Other non-mineralized lung micro nodularity.  Suggest CT follow-up

EXAMINATION:  CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST,  04/14/2018
 
INDICATION: 54-year-old M with given reason for exam of "fever
increased pain".
 
TECHNIQUE:  CT imaging obtained from lung bases through the symphysis
pubis following intravenous administration of 100 ml Omnipaque-300
iodinated contrast media.  Multiplanar 2-D reformations performed.
Individualized radiation dose reduction techniques were used.
 
COMPARISON:  04/10/2018
 
FINDINGS:  The visible lowermost chest reveals a normal-sized heart.
Minimal pleural thickening seen right lung base.  I see no acute
consolidation or edema.
 
In the abdomen, the liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands and kidneys
appear generally normal in morphology and enhancement pattern.  Liver
may be slightly hypoattenuating, cannot exclude possibility of fatty
liver disease.  There is calcific atherosclerotic plaque in the
abdominal aorta but no AAA.  No dissection.  I see no upper abdominal
or central mesenteric adenopathy.
 
In the right lower quadrant abdomen, there is abnormal inflammatory
change.  Seems previous surgery in the region with small staple line.
Regional mesocolic reactive adenopathy noted.  No measurable drainable
fluid collection/abscess noted.  I presume the appendix was resected?
The regional inflammation is increased compared with 04/10/2018.
 
There is trace free fluid in the pelvis, also increased from 04/10 but
again no drainable fluid collection.  No bowel obstruction.
 
Urinary bladder is grossly remarkable.
 
Visible osseous structures reveal moderate lower lumbar facet
overgrowth.  No acute or aggressive appearing osseous process detected.
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  Increasing inflammation right lower quadrant and trace pelvic free
fluid.  However, no definitive "mature" drainable
abscess detected at this time.
2.  Minimal pleural thickening/atelectasis right lung base, also
developing.  No drainable pleural effusion.

Segmental pressures were obtained for ABI determination at rest.
 
COMPARISON:  No relevant recent prior study available.
 
FINDINGS:  ABI is abnormal at 0.8. There is, however, triphasic flow in
the common femoral and profunda femoris and superficial femoral
arteries albeit moderately turbulent.  Still sharp systolic upstroke.
Popliteal artery reveals triphasic flow, also turbulent.  Posterior
tibial and peroneal and dorsalis pedis are generally monophasic,
bimodal. Still sharp systolic upstroke.
 
IMPRESSION:  Likely long-segment disease particularly in the runoff
vessels right lower extremity.  No focal blunting systolic peak seen in
a pattern to localize any high-grade flow-limiting stenosis from the
groin through the ankle.

EXAMINATION:  NUCLEAR MEDICINE HEPATOBILIARY SCAN,  04/14/2018
 
INDICATION: 62-year-old M with given reason for exam of "nausea and
vomiting."  Increased LFTs.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Anterior planar images obtained of the abdomen out to 1
hour following intravenous administration 5.4 mCi
technetium-99m-labeled mebrofenin. Following this, fatty meal challenge
was provided in the form of 8oz. Pulmocare PO, and the gallbladder was
imaged over 60 minutes.  Regions of interest drawn, yielding a
time-activity curve
 
COMPARISON:  Sonography and CT over past day.
 
FINDINGS:  There is prompt uptake of radiotracer in the liver with
rapid clearance of the blood pool.  Ductal and gallbladder activity
seen by 30 minutes.  Bowel activity not seen until after fatty meal
stimulus.  There is blunted response of the gallbladder with maximal
ejection fraction of only 14%.
 
IMPRESSION:  Delayed biliary to bowel transit and blunted response to
fatty meal stimulus/biliary dyskinesia.  Cannot exclude chronic
cholecystitis, but there is no scintigraphic evidence of cystic duct
obstruction to suggest acute cholecystitis.

mass in the region of the splenic hilum. This previously with sub
centimeter in size measuring 8 mm. There is a 3.3 x 4.1 cm mesenteric
mass in the left upper abdomen.  There has been prominent increase in
size and the left adnexal mass which now measures 19 x 11.8 cm in size.
A small amount of free fluid is seen in the pelvis.  The aorta appears
appropriate diameter.  There is no bowel obstruction.  A filter is seen
within the IVC.  Bladder is unremarkable. No acute bony changes are
noted.
 
IMPRESSION(S):
1.  Prominent increase in size of left adnexal mass concerning for
malignancy now measuring 19 x 11.8 cm in size.
2.  3.3 x 4.1 cm left upper quadrant mesenteric mass likely metastasis.
3.  2.4 x 2 cm mass within the splenic hilum also likely representing a
metastasis.
4.  Small to moderate amount of ascites within the abdomen and pelvis.
5.  Multiple liver cysts unchanged from prior study.
6.  Cholecystectomy.
7.  The common bile duct is dilated measuring 13 mm.  This is greater
in diameter than on the prior study.  No obvious obstructing lesion is
seen on this exam.

Procedure Ordered: 13585516~60004~PMR ORBIT FACE NECK W+WO CONTRAST~70543~99999901
Admitting DX: C43.11-Malignant melanoma of right eyelid, including canthus
Working DX: C43.11-Malignant melanoma of right eyelid, including canthus
 

MRI of brain and orbits with and without contrast
 
INDICATION(S):  Melanoma of left eyelid.  Evaluate involvement.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar MRI examination of the brain and orbits was
performed before and after the administration of 7 ml of ProHance.
 
COMPARISON:  PET/CT dated 11/13/2017.
 
Findings:
 
There is abnormal lobular somewhat hyperintense T2-weighted signal
anterior to the left globe.  This measures approximately 4 cm maximum
transverse dimension, spans a depth of at least 1.7 cm, and spans a
craniocaudal length of approximately 1.9 cm.  The mass abuts the
anterior margin of the left globe.  No deformity of the left globe
contour however. The mass is predominately hypointense on T1-weighted
images and exhibits enhancement after contrast administration.  The
mass extends posteriorly along the superior margin of the left globe
best seen on series 11 image 8 but there is no definite retro-orbital
extension.
 
There is no evidence of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarct.
 
Global volume loss with associated ventricular dilatation is
commensurate with age.  Scattered nonspecific parenchymal FLAIR
hyperintensities are in the cerebral hemispheres.  No mass effect or
midline shift.  No abnormal extra-axial fluid collections.  Major
intracranial flow voids are grossly maintained.  Punctate focus of
susceptibility artifact in the medial left parietal lobe is nonspecific
and could represent calcification or focus of hemosiderin deposition.
No gross abnormality of the sella.  The basilar cisterns are patent.
 
There is no abnormal parenchymal enhancement.
 
Bilateral cataract surgery.  Paranasal sinuses are clear.  Tiny mastoid
effusions.
 
Impression:
 
Lobular mass anterior to the left globe as described which would be
consistent with the provided history of melanoma.  No significant
retro-orbital extension.  No intracranial metastasis identified.
 
No acute infarct.  Global volume loss with presumed chronic
microvascular ischemic changes.

Admitting DX: M51.26-Other intervertebral disc displacement, lumbar region
Working DX: M51.26-Other intervertebral disc displacement, lumbar region
 

EXAM:  MRI of the lumbar spine with and without IV contrast.
 
INDICATION:  Other intervertebral disc displacement, lumbar region.
Low back pain radiating to both legs.
 
COMPARISON:  Lumbar CT myelogram dated 03/12/2015.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar MRI examination of the lumbar spine was
performed before and after the administration of ProHance IV contrast.
 
FINDINGS:
 
This report assumes that there are five lumbar vertebral bodies.
Lumbar spine alignment is normal. The lumbar vertebral bodies are
normal height.  Modic type 1 endplate changes are end L5-S1.  Several
intervertebral discs are desiccated.  The conus terminates at L1.
 
T12-L1:  The central canal and neural foramen are widely patent.
 
L1-L2:  There is facet hypertrophy but the central canal and neural
foramen are widely patent.
 
L2-L3:  Disc bulge indents the ventral thecal sac.  The neural foramen
are widely patent although there is some facet hypertrophy.
 
L3-L4:  Disc bulge flattens the ventral thecal sac.  Along with facet
hypertrophy there may be crowding upon the descending L4 nerve roots in
the lateral recesses.  The neural foramina may be mildly narrowed.
 
L4-L5:  Disc bulge with a central protrusion indents the ventral thecal
sac.  There is slight asymmetric crowding upon the descending left L5
nerve root in the left lateral recess.  Facet hypertrophy may mildly
narrow the neural foramina.
 
L5-S1:  There are postop changes of L5-S1 laminectomy.  Nonspecific T1
hypointense enhancing material in the laminectomy defect extends
anteriorly into the epidural space surrounding the descending S1 nerve
roots, right greater than left.  Disc bulge indents the ventral thecal
sac and approximates the anterior margin of the descending S1 nerve
roots.  Disc material, posterior osteophytic change, and facet
hypertrophy cause moderate - severe bilateral neural foraminal stenosis
probable abutment of the exiting L5 nerve roots as well.
 
No other abnormal CNS enhancement.
 
The visualized visceral structures show no gross abnormalities.
 
 
 
IMPRESSION:
Postoperative changes of L5-S1 laminectomy with presumed epidural
fibrosis extending anteriorly toward and likely surrounding the
descending S1 nerve roots.
 
Persistent disc bulge and L5-S1 with disc material approximating the
descending S1 nerve roots.  Foraminal stenosis bilaterally at L5-S1 may
result in abutment of the exiting L5 nerve roots as well.  Please
correlate for bilateral L5 and S1 radiculopathies.
 
Milder degenerative changes at L3-L4 and L4-L5 as described.

MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST
 
INDICATION:  sellar mass on ct
 
COMPARISON:  Head CT dated 04/30/2018.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar MRI of the brain was performed before and after
the administration of 14 ml ProHance IV contrast.
 
FINDINGS:
There is a large mass lesion in the sella/suprasellar region.  The mass
shows slight precontrast T1 hyperintensity with heterogeneous
enhancement and areas of necrosis most apparent in its superior
portion.  Maximum dimensions of the mass are approximately 2.9 cm
cranial-caudal by 2.3 cm transverse by 2.2 cm AP. There is significant
mass effect upon the undersurface of the optic chiasm and the pre
chiasmatic optic nerves.  There is approximation of the undersurface of
the anterior communicating artery complex.  No cavernous sinus invasion.
 
There is no evidence of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarct.
Global volume loss with associated ventricular dilatation.  The degree
of ventricular dilatation is questionably disproportionate to the
background of underlying volume loss, particularly in the lateral
ventricles.  Patchy areas of FLAIR hyperintensity are in the cerebral
hemispheres.  No midline shift or other abnormal extra-axial fluid
collection.  Major intracranial flow voids are grossly maintained.  No
evidence of parenchymal hemorrhage.  The basilar cisterns are otherwise
patent.
 
No abnormal parenchymal enhancement after contrast administration.
 
Left periorbital scalp hematoma.  Bilateral cataract surgery.  Mild
paranasal sinus mucosal thickening.  Tiny mastoid effusions.
 
IMPRESSION:
2.9 cm sellar/suprasellar mass as described above with mass effect upon
the undersurface of the optic chiasm and both pre chiasmatic optic
nerves.  This likely reflects a pituitary macroadenoma.  The lateral
ventricles are questionably disproportionate to the remainder of
ventricular dilatation elsewhere and it is possible that the mass is
stored in to exerts slight mass effect upon the undersurface of the
foramen of Monro.
 
No acute infarct.
 
Global volume loss with presumed chronic microvascular ischemic
changes.

EXAM:  MRI of the lumbar spine without IV contrast
 
INDICATION:  Low back pain.  Severe right leg pain.
 
COMPARISON:  Lumbar MRI dated 08/26/2017.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar MRI evaluation was performed without IV
contrast.
 
FINDINGS:
 
This report assumes that there are five lumbar vertebral bodies.
Lumbar spine alignment is normal.  The lumbar vertebral bodies are
normal height.  Some of the intervertebral discs are desiccated.  The
conus terminates at L1-L2.
 
T12-L1:  The central canal and neural foramen are widely patent.
 
L1-L2:  There is trace disc bulge but the central canal and neural
foramen are widely patent.
 
L2-L3:  There is trace disc bulge but the central canal and neural
foramen are widely patent.
 
L3-L4:  The central canal and neural foramen are widely patent.
 
L4-L5:  There is a left foraminal protrusion which along with facet
hypertrophy mildly narrows the left neural foramen.  Posterior
osteophytic change may minimally narrow the right neural foramen.
There is approximation of the undersurface of both exiting L4 nerve
roots.
 
L5-S1:  The central canal and neural foramen are widely patent.
 
The visualized proximal exiting sacral nerve roots are grossly
unimpinged.  The visualized visceral structures show no gross
abnormalities.
 
IMPRESSION:
Mild degenerative changes most apparent at L4-L5.  This is similar to
prior.  No focal nerve root impingement.

chest.  Minimal right pleural effusion.  There is trace right
pneumothorax noted with indwelling smaller caliber right-sided pleural
thoracostomy tube. Other smaller caliber pleural/pericardial drain
suggested.
 
Only a small pericardial effusion.
 
Central venous access device is in place with tip to the SVC.  Thoracic
aorta appears grossly normal size.  Ostial markers noted post CABG.
Feeding tube in place to the abdomen, tip not well seen .  There is a

EXAMINATION:  CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST,  04/14/2018
 
INDICATION: 31-year-old M with given reason for exam of "pneumonia/PE".
 
TECHNIQUE:  CT imaging obtained from the lung apices through the lung
bases following intravenous administration of 70 ml Omnipaque-300
iodinated contrast media.  Multiplanar 2-D reformations performed.
Individualized radiation dose reduction techniques were used.
 
COMPARISON:  Chest radiography 04/14/2018, CT, 04/10/2018
 
FINDINGS:  There are small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater
than right. There is total consolidation of both lower lobes of the
lung with central and peripheral bronchial occlusion as well,
essentially completely "drowned" lower lobes lung bilaterally.  On the
right, extensive internal cavitary likely necrotizing pneumonia again
notable as on previous.  The degree of left lower lobe opacification
has worsened, now involving the entirety of the left lower lobe of the
lung.
 
Still some infiltrates in the upper lung zones, though again the right
upper lobe has significantly reinflated currently compared with prior
CT. There is no pneumothorax.  I do see air/debris level in the trachea
and left mainstem bronchus in particular.
 
Some subpleural infiltrate in the left upper lobe of the lung are more
impressive currently than on April 10.
 
Moderate mediastinal and hilar adenopathy noted, more prominent than a
few days ago, presumably reactive.  Subcarinal node is up to 1.9 cm in
short axis.  Pulmonary arteries appear fairly well opacified, with no
filling defect evident in a pattern to suggest acute pulmonary
thromboembolism.  Heart size is normal.  There is no pericardial
effusion.
 
Endotracheal tube is in place.  NG tube in place to the stomach.  No
adrenal mass evident.
 
Visible osseous structures reveal benign sclerotic lesion in the mid
thoracic spine.  No acute or aggressive appearing osseous process
detected.
 
Again a percutaneous right-sided pleural pigtail thoracostomy tube
remains.
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  Negative for acute pulmonary thromboembolism.
2.  Severe pneumonia bilateral lower lobes with bronchial opacification
and "drowned" lung. Significant necrotizing component on the right with
heterogeneous lung apices. On the left, now total involvement of the
entirety of the left lower lobe of the lung.
3.  Again no pneumothorax.  Right-sided pigtail thoracostomy tube
remains.
4.  Slight new infiltrate in the nondependent anterior segment left
upper lobe of the lung, subpleural,
subsegmental.
5.  Decreasing infiltrate/consolidation/compressive atelectasis right
upper lobe of the lung compared with April 10, 2018.

Admitting DX: M54.16-Radiculopathy, lumbar region
Working DX: M54.16-Radiculopathy, lumbar region
 

EXAM:  MRI of the lumbar spine without IV contrast
 
INDICATION:  Radiculopathy, lumbar region.  Low back pain and bilateral
leg pain.
 
COMPARISON:  None available.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar MRI evaluation was performed without IV
contrast.
 
FINDINGS:
 
There are five lumbar vertebral bodies.  Lumbar spine alignment is
normal.  The lumbar vertebral bodies are normal height with a few
scattered Schmorl's nodes.  Some of the intervertebral discs are
desiccated.  The conus terminates at L1-L2. Questionable T1
hyperintensity within the thecal sac on the axial images is not
corroborated in the sagittal plane and may be artifactual.
 
T12-L1:  The central canal and neural foramen are widely patent.
 
L1-L2:  Disc bulge with a central protrusion indents the ventral thecal
sac and partially effaces the CSF within it, narrowing the thecal sac
to a maximum AP dimension of 4 mm.  The neural foramen are widely
patent.
 
L2-L3:  There is facet hypertrophy but the central canal and neural
foramen are widely patent.  The posterior epidural fat is somewhat
prominent.
 
L3-L4:  The posterior epidural fat is somewhat prominent.  Facet
hypertrophy may mildly narrow the neural foramina.  The central canal
is otherwise patent.
 
L4-L5:  Disc bulge minimally indents the ventral thecal sac.  There may
be slight crowding upon the descending L5 nerve roots in the lateral
recesses. Protruded disc material extends into the right neural foramen
and likely abuts the exiting right L4 nerve root.  Disc material and
facet hypertrophy cause at least mild - moderate left neural foraminal
stenosis as well.
 
L5-S1:  Facet hypertrophy causes at least mild foraminal stenosis
bilaterally.  The central canal is widely patent.
 
The visualized proximal exiting sacral nerve roots are grossly
unimpinged.
 
IMPRESSION:
Severe central stenosis at L1-L2 where a disc protrusion narrows the
thecal sac to just 4 mm maximum AP dimension.
 
Abutment of the exiting right L4 nerve root in the L4-L5 neural foramen
secondary to some protruded disc material.  Please correlate for right
L4 radiculopathy.
 
Milder degenerative changes elsewhere as described.

MRI BRAIN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST
 
INDICATION:  syncope recurrent
 
COMPARISON:  Head CT dated 04/13/2018
 
TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar MRI examination of the brain was performed
without intravenous contrast.
 
FINDINGS:
The study is degraded by motion.
 
There is mild diffusion restriction in the cortex of the medial right
occipital lobe best seen on series 1 image 16.
 
There are additional foci of diffusion hyperintensity in the right
posterior periventricular region on series 1 image 18 and in the left
corona radiata on series 1 image 21, but these foci exhibit T2 shine
through on ADC map.
 
No mass effect or midline shift.  There is a tiny (1-2 mm) extra-axial
collection over the posterior right cerebral convexity for example on
series 5 image 13 best seen on the FLAIR images.  Scattered nonspecific
parenchymal FLAIR hyperintensities are present in the periventricular
and deep white matter of the cerebral hemispheres.  Several of these
are oriented in a linear fashion perpendicular to the corpus callosum
for example on series 5 image 16.  Major intracranial flow voids are
grossly maintained.  No increased susceptibility to suggest parenchymal
hemorrhage.  No gross abnormality of the sella.  The basilar cisterns
are patent.
 
Intravenous contrast was not administered.  No gross orbital
abnormalities.  Minimal paranasal sinus mucosal thickening.  Mastoid
air cells are clear.
 
 
 
IMPRESSION:
Mild diffusion restriction in the cortex of the medial right occipital
lobe.  This is nonspecific.  It could potentially be due to acute
infarction but isolated involvement of the cortex is somewhat unusual
and other etiologies including recent seizure activity or encephalitis
could be considered in the appropriate setting.  Please clinically
correlate.
 
Tiny 1-2 mm extra-axial collection over the right cerebral convexity
probably represents a tiny subdural hemorrhage given history of
recurrent syncope.  This was not conspicuous on the recent head CT due
to its size.
 
Nonspecific parenchymal FLAIR hyperintensities. These could be due to
accelerated microvascular ischemic change as the patient reports a
history of chronic renal disease but the orientation/configuration of
the FLAIR hyperintensities raises the possibility of an underlying
demyelinating disorder (clinician reports patient does indeed have a
history of multiple sclerosis).   The patient reports that she has
undergone MRI of brain an outside institution and if those outside
studies become available they can be compared to this exam and an
addendum to this report can be issued.
 
Discussed with Dr Antonicci at 0809 on 4/14/18.

EXAMINATION:  CORONARY CT ANGIOGRAM/CTA chest,  04/14/2018
 
INDICATION: 32-year-old M with given reason for exam of "substernal
chest pain."
 
TECHNIQUE:  Thin-slice helical CT images obtained through the heart
during intravenous administration of 100 ml Isovue 370 iodinated
contrast media. Extensive multiplanar 2-D and 3-D reformations
performed, including curved MPR vessel tracking.  Individualized
radiation dose reduction techniques were used.
 
COMPARISON:  Chest radiography earlier same date
 
FINDINGS:
 
Heart:
size - generally normal
percardium - no effusion
other morphology - seemingly overall normal morphology without
asymmetric chamber enlargement.  Valve planes appear mostly
unremarkable, aortic valve is incidentally tricuspid as expected.  No
intracardiac mural thrombus appreciable.
 
Coronary vessels:
Evaluation limited by a moderate motion artifact. The left main
pulmonary artery and proximal LAD appear generally patent, without
significant stenosis.  Limited evaluation of the distal LAD, diagonal
branches and circumflex.  Limited evaluation of the proximal right
coronary artery to its midportion, though the distal RCA is patent, and
the coronary system is right-dominant.
 
Other chest vessels:
Thoracic aorta is normal, with no dissection or aneurysm.
Pulmonary arterial tree appears generally well opacified, with no
filling defect evident in a pattern to suggest acute pulmonary
thromboembolism.  Major pulmonary veins are patent.
 
Other findings:
Mild dependent atelectasis in the lung bases.  No acute consolidation
or pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  No worrisome pulmonary
parenchymal nodularity.  Central airways in the chest appear patent.
No mediastinal fluid collection or mass evident. Sternum appears
intact.  Other visible osseous structures generally reveal no acute
fracture fragmentation or aggressive process.
 
Visible upper abdomen reveals no adrenal mass.  Liver may be somewhat
low in attenuation, fatty infiltration difficult to exclude.
 
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  The coronary system is right-dominant and the visible coronary
segments are patent without evidence of plaque or stenosis, but
multiple segments are obscured by motion on this examination.
2.  Negative for acute pulmonary thromboembolism.
3.  Negative for aortic dissection or other acute aortic pathology.
4.  No other alternative etiology seen to explain reported substernal
pain here.  Sternum appears intact.
5.  Cannot exclude fatty liver disease.
 
 
CAD-RADS category:  N - Non-diagnostic study.  Obstructive CAD cannot
be excluded.

EXAM:  RCT SP LUMBAR W CONTRAST
 
HISTORY:  IVDA with loss of bowel/bladder control, r/o epidural abscess
 
TECHNIQUE:Contrast enhanced transaxial images of the lumbar spine are
obtained and reformatted in sagittal and coronal planes.
 
CONTRAST: 75cc Omnipaque-300 IV
 
COMPARISON: None
 
FINDINGS: There is suboptimal enhancement timing. The visualized
viscera and blood vessels show no enhancement.
 
Linear opacities at the left lung base likely atelectasis.  There are
no pleural effusions in the visualized lung bases. There is a 2 mm
nonobstructive right renal calculus.  There is no retroperitoneal
lymphadenopathy. Abdominal aorta demonstrates no aneurysm.  Visualized
bowel gas is unremarkable. Visualized urinary bladder is unremarkable.
The uterus is unremarkable.  Rounded hypodensities in the ovaries
likely represent underlying ovarian cyst.
 
CT of the lumbar spine demonstrates no evidence of fracture or
misalignment.  The vertebral body heights and intervertebral disc
spaces are maintained. No evidence of osteomyelitis or diskitis. The
paravertebral soft tissues are normal. Mild posterior disc bulges are
present L3-L4, L4- L5 and L5-S1 levels.  No central canal stenosis or
neural foramen compromise is seen. There is no evidence of epidural
abscess.  SI joints are symmetric.
 
IMPRESSION: Unremarkable CT of the lumbar spine. Nonobstructive right

HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST
 
INDICATION:  FALL
 
COMPARISON:  None available.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Routine CT imaging of the brain was performed without IV
contrast.
 
FINDINGS:
The study is slightly degraded by motion.  There is no definite
evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.  No midline
shift or abnormal extra-axial fluid collections.  Global volume loss
with associated ventricular dilatation.  Patchy areas of
hypoattenuation are present in the cerebral hemispheres.  Questionable
loss of gray-white differentiation in both occipital regions is not
definitive and may be artifactual.  The basilar cisterns are patent.
 
No acute orbital abnormalities. Remote fracture of the medial right
orbital wall.  The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells
are clear.  Atherosclerosis.
 
IMPRESSION:
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or other definite acute intracranial
abnormality.
 
Global volume loss with presumed chronic microvascular ischemic
changes.  Questionable loss of gray-white differentiation in both
occipital regions is not definitive and may be artifactual.  If there
is clinical concern for acute ischemic change consider MRI.

CT OF THE FACIAL BONES.
 
CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Fall, landing on the face.
 
TECHNIQUE:
Helical CT data were acquired through the facial bones without
administration of intravenous contrast material.  Data were
reconstructed into thin axial images. Coronal reformations were
obtained.  Individualized dose-optimization technique was utilized for
the procedure performed.
 
COMPARISON:
There is no prior relevant study at this facility.
 
FINDINGS:
The right lamina papyracea is concave, without edema.  This reflects
previous injury or congenital dehiscence.  The left lamina papyracea
has normal contours.  The other walls of the orbits appear normal
bilaterally.
 
The walls of the maxillary sinuses are intact, and the maxillary
antral-infundibular complexes are widely patent.  The nasal septum has
normal contours as do the nasal lacrimal bones.  The pterygoid plates
are intact, and the edentulous maxillary and mandibular alveolar ridges
have normal contours.  The mandible has normal cortical and trabecular
architecture and the temporomandibular joints are normally aligned.
Osseous contours of the skull base are normal.
 
Minimal imaging of basal brain parenchyma reveals diffuse volume loss
but no visible focal lesion.  The orbits and globes appear normal.  No
radiopaque foreign body is present in the superficial soft tissues.  In
the neck there is severe bilateral carotid calcification.
 
ASSESSMENT:
1.  No evidence of an acute facial fracture.
2.  Severe carotid calcification could be better characterized with
sonogram when patient condition permits.

CT CERVICAL SPINE WITHOUT IV CONTRAST
 
INDICATION:  FALL
 
COMPARISON:  None available.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Routine CT imaging of the cervical spine was performed
without IV contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were
obtained.
 
FINDINGS:
Unfortunately the study is significantly degraded by motion.  This
causes question of cervical malalignment particularly at C3 and C5-C6
on reconstructed images.  The cervical vertebral bodies are grossly
normal height.  The prevertebral soft tissues are unremarkable.  No
definite acute cervical spine fracture. Disc bulge indents the ventral
thecal sac at multiple levels.  Uncovertebral and facet hypertrophy
cause varying degrees of foraminal stenosis.  Visualized unenhanced
soft tissue structures of the neck show atherosclerosis.
 
IMPRESSION:
Motion degraded study.  Questionable malalignment is felt to be due to
motion artifact.  Consider a repeat study when the patient can better
tolerate or cervical spine radiographs.
 
Degenerative changes.  No definite acute cervical spine fracture
otherwise.

UNENHANCED CT OF THE ABDOMEN.
UNENHANCED CT OF THE PELVIS.
 
CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Fall, landing on the abdomen and face. Known liver mass.
 
TECHNIQUE:
Helical CT data were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis, from the
lung bases through the pubic symphysis, without administration of
intravenous contrast material.  Data were reconstructed into thin axial
images.  Sagittal and coronal reconstructions were obtained.
Individualized dose-optimization technique was utilized for the
procedure performed.
 
COMPARISON:
There is no relevant prior study at this facility. An abdomen sonogram
obtained in 2006 is no longer available.
 
FINDINGS:
Note:  The patient was imaged with her left arm across or abdomen,
creating artifacts.
 
Mild osteopenia is present.  There is a mild biconcave compression
deformity at T12, which is remodeled appearing and without paraspinal
hematoma.  No acute fracture deformity is visible.  Severe diffuse body
wall edema is present. There is a lentiform mixed density collection in
the left rectus abdominis musculature, 88 x 58 mm in the axial plane
and with craniocaudal span 15 cm, consistent with a hematoma and
potentially active bleeding (this study is unenhanced). Additional less
well encapsulated fluid is present more caudally in the left rectus
abdominis.
 
Abdomen:
Limited imaging of the lung bases reveals small bilateral pleural
effusions, with patchy somewhat nodular consolidation in the lower
lobes right worse than left.  The largest discrete nodule is in the
medial basal right lower lobe, 8 x 5 mm on image 7.  Mild cardiomegaly
is present.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted.
 
The liver is cirrhotic with nodular contours.  In this unenhanced study
no focal lesion is visible.  Craniocaudal hepatic span is 16.3 cm at
the midclavicular line.  The spleen has long-axis dimension 14.2 cm,
with no visible focal lesion.  Moderate ascites is present.  A large
hiatal hernia is present and there are small varices adjacent to it.  A
small recanalized periumbilical vein is present. The gallbladder is
moderately filled.  13 4 mm calculus is present at its neck.  The
pancreas appears normal.  The right adrenal gland has what appears to
be an adipose nodule on image 40, though the area is somewhat blurred,
perhaps a myelolipoma.  The kidneys have normal contours with no
hydronephrosis or focal lesion.  The jejunum is markedly edematous but
the ileum and duodenum are less so.
 
Pelvis:
The urinary bladder is moderately filled.  The uterus has normal
contours.  No adnexal mass is visible.  Ascites layers in the pelvic
recesses. The colon has normal contours and caliber, with large-volume
fecal material in its proximal segments, with no edema or focal lesion.
The appendix appears normal.
 
ASSESSMENT:
1.  Large hematoma in the left rectus abdominis musculature.  Active
bleeding is neither confirmed or excluded in this unenhanced study.
2.  Bilateral lower lobe patchy consolidation and volume loss, likely
aspiration pneumonia.  Some of this disease is nodular, so follow-up is
recommended after therapy.
3.  Anasarca, with small pleural effusions, severe body wall edema, and
ascites.  This is associated with hepatic cirrhosis, with
hepatosplenomegaly.
4.  Severe edema is present in the jejunum.  This may be encountered in
portal hypertension or hyperproteinemia, though in the appropriate
circumstance an enteritis could certainly have this appearance.  The
rest of the small intestine and the colon are not involved.
5.  Hiatal hernia and other incidental findings as above.

MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST
 
INDICATION:  Abnormal MRI. History of brain lesions and epilepsy.
Evaluate for multiple sclerosis.
 
COMPARISON:  None available.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar MRI of the brain was performed before and after
the administration of 12 ml ProHance IV contrast.
 
FINDINGS:
 
The study is degraded by motion.
 
There is no evidence of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarct.
 
The brain parenchyma shows scattered nonspecific FLAIR hyperintensities
in the white matter of the cerebral hemispheres. These are for the most
part in the deep white matter, although there is at least one area of
probable FLAIR hyperintensity in the right genu of the corpus callosum
best seen on series 3 image 15.  None of the FLAIR hyperintensities
exhibit corresponding T1 hypointense signal.  Maximum transverse
dimension of the third ventricle is 3 mm.
 
No mass effect or midline shift.  No abnormal extra-axial fluid
collections.  Major intracranial flow voids are grossly maintained.  No
increased susceptibility to suggest parenchymal hemorrhage.  No gross
abnormality of the sella.  The basilar cisterns are patent.
 
Following contrast administration, there are no abnormal foci of
parenchymal enhancement.
 
No gross orbital abnormalities.  Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air
cells are clear.
 
IMPRESSION:
No acute intracranial abnormality.
 
Scattered nonspecific parenchymal FLAIR hyperintensities.  None of
these are particularly specific for multiple sclerosis (and other
etiologies could be considered) except that there is probably one
lesion in the genu of the
corpus callosum which makes this diagnosis more likely.  CSF analysis
may be helpful if not already performed.  If and when outside
institution brain MRI examinations become available for comparison, an
addendum to this report can be issued.

CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE CHEST.
 
CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Chest pain.
 
TECHNIQUE:
Helical CT data were acquired through the chest, from the thoracic
inlet through the upper abdomen, during pulmonary artery enhancement.
Data were reconstructed into thin axial images.  Radial reconstructions
were obtained.  The patient received 100 ml Omnipaque-300 without
reported adverse event.  Individualized dose-optimization technique was
utilized for the procedure performed.
 
COMPARISON:
There is no relevant prior study at this facility.
 
FINDINGS:
Contrast opacification of the pulmonary arteries is adequate, though
there is motion blurring in the lung bases.  These arteries are normal
caliber without visible intraluminal thrombus  Contrast opacification
of the thoracic aorta is adequate to exclude an acute aortic process.
Heart size is borderline enlarged, with no pericardial effusion.
 
The lungs have normal volume with no consolidation, edema, or effusion.
A 2 mm nodule is present in the right mid lung anteriorly on image 74.
The central airways are patent.  There is no lymphadenopathy.
 
The liver is mildly steatotic with sparing along the gallbladder fossa,
incompletely imaged. Craniocaudal span is at least 17 cm and is
incompletely included. The adrenal glands appear normal.  There is a 3
mm left renal upper pole calculus without hydronephrosis.
 
No significant osseous abnormality is present.
 
ASSESSMENT:
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.  No acute pulmonary or pleural
abnormality.
2.  Hepatic steatosis and hepatomegaly, incompletely imaged

EXAM:  MRI of the lumbar spine without IV contrast
 
INDICATION: Low back and bilateral hip pain.
 
COMPARISON:  Lumbar radiographs dated 03/27/2018.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar MRI evaluation was performed without IV
contrast.
 
FINDINGS:
 
This report assumes that there are five lumbar vertebral bodies.  3 mm
anterolisthesis of L4 on L5.  Lumbar spine alignment is otherwise
normal.  The lumbar vertebral bodies are of normal height.  There is
question of diffuse T1 hypointense marrow signal although not
definitive.  Several intervertebral discs are desiccated.  The conus
terminates at L1.
 
T12-L1:  The central canal and neural foramen are widely patent.
 
L1-L2:  There is trace disc bulge and facet hypertrophy but the central
canal and neural foramen are widely patent.
 
L2-L3:  Disc bulge with a right paracentral protrusion asymmetrically
indents the right anterior thecal sac.  Posterior osteophytic change
and facet hypertrophy may mildly narrow the neural foramen especially
on the right.
 
L3-L4:  Disc bulge minimally indents the ventral thecal sac.  Posterior
osteophytic change and facet hypertrophy mildly narrows the neural
foramina with approximation of the undersurface of the exiting L3 nerve
roots.  Small posteriorly oriented left synovial cyst.
 
L4-L5:  Disc bulge indents and flattens the ventral thecal sac.
Posterior osteophytic change and facet hypertrophy cause mild -
moderate left and mild right neural foraminal stenosis with
approximation of both exiting L4 nerve roots.
 
L5-S1:  Facet hypertrophy may mildly narrow the neural foramina.  The
central canal is widely patent.
 
The visualized proximal exiting sacral nerve roots are grossly
unimpinged.
 
The visualized visceral structures show no gross abnormalities.
 
IMPRESSION:
Multilevel degenerative changes.  Mild multilevel central stenosis.
Varying degrees of foraminal stenosis are greatest at L4-L5.  No
definite nerve root impingement is appreciated.
 
Question T1 hypointense marrow signal although not definitive.  This
can be seen in any of a variety of hematogenous and/or
lymphoproliferative processes.  Please clinically correlate.

SONOGRAM OF THE LIVER.
 
CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Abnormal liver function tests.
 
TECHNIQUE:
Real-time high-resolution transcutaneous gray-scale and color Doppler
sonographic evaluation of the the liver and adjacent tissues.
 
COMPARISON:
CT of the abdomen and pelvis obtained January 24, 2018.
 
FINDINGS:
Image quality is overall adequate.
 
The pancreatic tail is obscured but central portions of the gland
appear normal.  The common duct is variable, ranging from 4 to 10 mm.
The liver has normal contours and echogenicity, with no focal lesion
and no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation.  The portal vein is patent
with antegrade flow. The gallbladder has normal contours and wall
thickness, with no sludge or calculus.  No sonographic Murphy's sign
was elicited. Small-volume ascites is present.
 
ASSESSMENT:
1.  Small-volume ascites.
2.  Variable extrahepatic bile duct caliber, ranging from 4 mm to 10
mm. This is nonspecific since the gallbladder appears normal. If there
is concern for choledocholithiasis then hepatobiliary scintigraphy
might be helpful.

UNENHANCED CT OF THE ABDOMEN.
UNENHANCED CT OF THE PELVIS.
 
CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Right flank pain.
 
TECHNIQUE:
Helical CT data were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis, from the
lung bases through the pubic symphysis, without administration of
intravenous contrast material.  Data were reconstructed into thin axial
images.  Sagittal and coronal reconstructions were obtained.
Individualized dose-optimization technique was utilized for the
procedure performed.
 
COMPARISON:
There is no relevant prior study at this facility.
 
FINDINGS:
Diffuse osteopenia is present with severe multilevel lumbar
degenerative disc and facet changes.  A mild caudal thoracic
compression deformity does not appear acute.  Mild to moderate body
wall edema is present.
 
Abdomen:
Limited imaging of the lung bases reveals bilateral pleural effusions
of 5-10%, with no pulmonary edema.  Moderate to severe calcification is
present at the coronary arteries, the aortic valve, and the mitral
annulus.  A small sliding hiatal hernia is present.
 
Multiple small calcific foci are present adjacent to and perhaps within
the right ureter on image 80 and image 87.  No hydronephrosis is
present.  The left kidney has multiple cysts.  The spleen, liver,
gallbladder, pancreas, and adrenal glands appear normal.  The
unopacified abdominal GI tract appears intrinsically normal.  Dense
aortic calcification is present.  There is no lymphadenopathy or free
fluid.
 
Pelvis:
The urinary bladder is thick-walled and surrounded by mild perivesical
edema.  The uterus is absent, and there is no visible adnexal mass.
The colon has numerous diverticula without evidence of diverticulitis.
A small caudal left linea semilunaris hernia contains the distal
descending colon without evidence of obstruction.  The transverse colon
passes adjacent to a small fat-containing umbilical hernia.  The
appendix appears normal.  No pelvic lymphadenopathy is present.
 
ASSESSMENT:
1.  The urinary bladder is thick-walled and surrounded by perivesical
edema, consistent with cystitis.
2.  Tiny calcific foci are present adjacent to the right ureter.  Since
there is no hydronephrosis these are probably tiny phleboliths rather
than intraureteral calculi.
3.  Body wall edema and small pleural effusions.

COMPARISON: No relevant prior exam
 
TECHNIQUE: Multiple noncontrast CT images of the head were obtained.
Individualized dose optimalization was used.
 
FINDINGS:
  There are regions of low attenuation in the perventricular white
matter that most likely represent chronic small vessel ischemic change.
This process and limitations of NONcontract head CT makes evaluation of
acute ischemia suboptimal.  Further imaging can be performed as needed.
  No acute hemorrhage. Mild sinus disease. No acute fracture.
 
 
IMPRESSION:
No acute process.

LIMITED OBSTETRIC SONOGRAM:  transabdominal imaging.
 
CLINICAL INFORMATION:
This 23 year-old pregnant woman presents for evaluation of right flank
pain.  Her last menstrual period is unknown but she presents with an
estimated gestational age of 22 weeks 0 days and estimated delivery
date of August 18, 2018.
 
TECHNIQUE:
Real-time high-resolution transabdominal grey-scale and color/spectral
Doppler sonographic evaluation of the developing gestation.
 
COMPARISON:
There is no relevant prior study at this facility.
 
FINDINGS:
Image quality is adequate.  A single living intrauterine gestation is
present.  It is currently in breech position.  The placenta is
anterior, with no cyst-like change or calcification.  No subchorionic
fluid is visible. Fetal heart rate is 151 beats per minute in M-mode
imaging.
 
No screening anatomic evaluation was performed, but the following
biometric measurements were obtained:
Biparietal diameter, 5.72 cm (23 weeks 4 days).
Head circumference, 20.65 cm (22 weeks 5 days).
Occipital/frontal distance, 7.07 cm.
Abdominal circumference, 17.24 cm (22 weeks 1 day).
Femur length, 3.79 cm (22 weeks 1 day).
 
These measurements yield an average ultrasound age of 22 weeks 5 days,
plus or minus 1 week 4 days, which is consistent with the provided
estimated delivery date, within the error range.  Based on today's
examination the estimated delivery date would be August 13, 2018.
Estimated fetal weight is 489 grams, plus or minus 73 grams.  This is
58th percentile.  The ratio of head circumference to abdominal
circumference is in the normal range at 1.20.  The ratio of femur
length to head circumference is 18.33, slightly below the normal range.
 
Amniotic fluid is measured 6.24 cm plus 6.81 cm plus 2.03 cm plus 5.10
cm, for a total AFI of 20.2 cm.
 
The right kidney has minimal pelvocaliceal fluid prominence without
calyceal dilation.  The ureter is 6-7 mm, which is within the normal
range.
 
ASSESSMENT:
1.  A single living intrauterine gestation is present, with heart rate
151 beats per minute. The placenta is anterior.  No acute process is
visible.  Average ultrasound age is 22 weeks, 5 days, plus or minus 1
week 4 days.  This is consistent (within the error range) with the
provided estimated delivery date.  The ratio of femur length to head
circumference is slightly below the normal range.
2.  The right kidney has minimal pelvocaliceal fluid prominence without
calyceal dilation or pathologic ureteral dilation.

TECHNIQUE: Multiple noncontrast CT images of the head were obtained.
Individualized dose optimalization was used.
 
FINDINGS:
  There are regions of low attenuation in the perventricular white
matter that most likely represent chronic small vessel ischemic change
and age related atrophy.  This process and limitations of NONcontract
head CT makes evaluation of acute ischemia suboptimal.  Further imaging
can be performed as needed.
  No acute hemorrhage. Mild sinus disease. No acute fracture.

CT CERVICAL SPINE WITHOUT IV CONTRAST
 
INDICATION:  Trauma.  Fall.
 
COMPARISON:  None available.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Routine CT imaging of the cervical spine was performed
without IV contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were
obtained.
 
FINDINGS:
Unfortunately the study is markedly suboptimal due to motion.
Reconstructed images show questionable anterolisthesis of C2 on C3 but
this is perhaps due to motion.  Cervical spine alignment is otherwise
grossly normal. The cervical spine vertebral bodies are grossly normal
height.  No other definite evidence to suggest an acute cervical spine
fracture.
 
In the posterior left central canal at the C5 level there is a bulky
calcification measuring 1.1 cm which indents the left posterior thecal
sac and along with posterior osteophytic change narrows the left side
of the thecal sac to 4-5 mm maximum dimension.
 
Disc bulge indents the ventral thecal sac at multiple other levels.
Varying degrees of foraminal stenosis are worst at C4-C5.
 
Atherosclerosis. Questionable 4 mm right apical pulmonary nodule on
image 100.
 
IMPRESSION:
Severely motion degraded study.  Questionable anterolisthesis of C2 on
C3 could be due to motion.  Recommend a repeat exam or cervical spine
radiographs to further evaluate.
 
Large calcification in the left posterior central canal at the C5 level
causes severe central stenosis.  This could be degenerative in nature
related to ligamentum flavum calcification or perhaps due to a
meningioma.  MRI would be helpful to further evaluate.
 
Degenerative changes, otherwise most apparent at C4-C5.
 
Probable 4 mm right apical pulmonary nodule.  Consider dedicated
thoracic imaging.

UNENHANCED CT OF THE ABDOMEN.
UNENHANCED CT OF THE PELVIS.
 
CLINICAL INFORMATION:
Fall.  Altered mental status.
 
TECHNIQUE:
Helical CT data were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis, from the
lung bases through the pubic symphysis, without administration of
intravenous contrast material.  Data were reconstructed into thin axial
images.  Sagittal and coronal reconstructions were obtained.
Individualized dose-optimization technique was utilized for the
procedure performed.
 
COMPARISON:
Unenhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis obtained December 10, 2017.
 
FINDINGS:
Diffuse osteopenia is present.  There is moderate disc degenerative
change at the lumbosacral junction.  A mild to moderate endplate
deformity is present at superior T11, and a small Schmorl's node is
present at superior L4; both are unchanged compared to December 2017.
A left femoral nail is incompletely imaged.  A sternotomy appears
united, without wires in the field of view.  Moderate to severe body
wall edema is present.
 
Abdomen:
Limited imaging of the lung bases reveals mild dependent atelectasis,
along with patchy ground-glass opacities.  A 5% left effusion and a 10%
right effusion are present.  Heart size is normal, with incompletely
imaged CABG changes.
 
Imaging through the abdomen is limited by beam-hardening and field of
view artifacts, since the patient was imaged with her arms by her side.
The gallbladder is surgically absent with no visible biliary ductal
dilation.  The liver and spleen appear normal though there is trace
fluid around the perihepatic space.  The pancreas has no visible focal
lesion.  The adrenal glands are obscured.  The kidneys are moderately
obscured as well but they have at least normal contours without
hydronephrosis.  The unopacified abdominal GI tract appears normal, as
visible.  A small umbilical hernia contains fat.  No free air or
dependent free fluid is present.  There is no lymphadenopathy.
 
Pelvis:
The urinary bladder appears normal.  Small-volume fluid is present in
the pelvis.  The uterus has normal contours, and no discrete adnexal
mass is present.  The colon appears normal.  The appendix is not
visible.
 
ASSESSMENT:
1.  Imaging of the abdomen is degraded by beam-hardening artifacts
because the patient was imaged with her arms by her side.
2.  Small-volume free fluid is present in the abdomen and in the pelvic
recesses. Although the patient also has body wall edema and small
pleural effusions, suggesting anasarca, in the setting of trauma this
would at least raises the possibility of an occult visceral injury.
3.  No acute fracture is visible.  Compression deformity at T11, and L4
superior endplate Schmorl's node, are unchanged compared to December
2017, and not acute.

EXAM: RCT BRAIN OR HEAD WO CONTRAST
 
HISTORY: ELDERLY FALL ON TO HEAD
 
TECHNIQUE: Nonenhanced axial images of the head were acquired.
 
COMPARISON: 05/31/2016
 
FINDINGS: In the left parietal convexity there are small focal areas of
hyperdensity suggestive of a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Additionally
there is very small subdural hematoma in the left parietal convexity
measuring less than 2 mm. No acute intra-axial, white matter edema or
midline shift.  Ventricles are normal sized. There is diffuse cerebral
and cerebellar atrophy.  Hypodensities in the periventricular regions
of white matter likely represent chronic white matter ischemic changes.
 
Bone windows show no fractures. There are small contusion along the
right parietal and occipital scalp.
 
The paranasal sinuses are clear.
 
IMPRESSION: Small subarachnoid and subdural hematomas in the left
parietal convexity. Small soft tissue contusions involving the right
parietal and occipital scalp.
 
The findings were communicated to Dr. Scribner by telephone on 02:36,
who expressed understanding.
 
 
While no definitive evidence for acute ischemia is apparent, acute
ischemic changes can be radiographically occult by CT scan and MRI with
diffusion weighted imaging can be performed if clinically indicated in
further evaluation.

EXAM: SCT ABD/PELVIS WO CONTRAST
 
HISTORY: n/v
 
TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast enhanced transaxial images of the abdomen and
pelvis were acquired from the lung bases to the symphysis pubis.
 
COMPARISON: None
 
FINDINGS: Exam is limited by lack of IV contrast.
 
There is atelectasis in the lingula. There are no pleural effusions at
the bases. There is a hiatal hernia.
 
The liver, spleen, pancreas,  and adrenal glands are unremarkable. The
gallbladder surgically absent.  Surgical clips in the gallbladder fossa.
 
The bowel gas pattern is normal. The stomach, small bowel and large
bowel are unremarkable.
 
The kidneys are normal size.  There is a 6.2 cm cyst in the upper pole
of the left kidney. There is a 14 mm cyst in the lower pole of the
right kidney. No obstructive changes  seen in the kidneys. Small
calcification overlying the right mid kidney may represent vascular
calcification rather than nonobstructing calculus.
 
There is no pathological adenopathy in the abdomen or pelvis. There are
no focal inflammatory changes. Small fat containing umbilical hernia.
 
The appendix is believed to be visualized and has a normal appearance.
There are no inflammatory changes in the right lower quadrant.
 
The urinary bladder is unremarkable.
 
The uterus is present.
 
There is a infrarenal abdominal aorta measuring up to approximately 4.2
cm in diameter.  Endovascular stent is present within the aneurysm
extending from approximately the level of the renal veins to the aortic
bifurcation and into the right common iliac artery. The right common
iliac artery appears aneurysmal measuring up to 2.3 cm. There is dense
atherosclerotic calcification throughout the abdominal aorta and in the
pelvic vessels. There is a graft extending from the left to right
femoral arteries.
 
No suspicious osseous lesions are identified. Osseous structures are
demineralized. Multilevel severe compression fractures are present in
the lumbar spine including L1 and L3. There is a moderate compression
deformity of L4. The paravertebral soft tissues surrounding these
compression fractures appear unremarkable and  these findings are
likely chronic.  Multilevel spondylosis is seen throughout the lumbar
spine. Advanced degenerative disc disease at L5-S1.  Multilevel disc
vacuum phenomenon is present extending from T11-L4 and also at the
L5-S1 level. There is a healed fracture of the right inferior pubic
ramus.
 
IMPRESSION:
 
1. Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with endovascular stenting
extending into the right common iliac artery.
 
2. Femoral to femoral artery bypass grafting seen along the anterior
lower pelvis.
 
3. Bilateral renal cysts.
 
4. Multilevel chronic-appearing compression fractures in the lumbar
spine.

EXAM:  MRI of the lumbar spine without IV contrast
 
INDICATION:  Intervertebral disc disorders w radiculopathy, lumbar
region.  Low back pain. Bilateral leg pain.
 
COMPARISON:  Lumbar MRI dated 04/14/2017.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar MRI evaluation was performed without IV
contrast.
 
FINDINGS:
 
There are five lumbar vertebral bodies.  Lumbar spine alignment is
normal except for question of 2 mm retrolisthesis of L5 on S1.  The
lumbar vertebral bodies are normal height.  There is STIR
hyperintensity in the superior L5 endplate.  On sagittal T1-weighted
images there is question of tiny developing Schmorl's nodes in the
superior L5 endplate (series 2 image 10 and series 2 image 4).  Several
intervertebral discs are desiccated.  L4-L5 disc shows a small annular
tear.  The conus terminates at L1.
 
T12-L1 through L2-L3:  The central canal and neural foramen are widely
patent.
 
L3-L4:  Disc bulge with a right paracentral protrusion asymmetrically
indents the right anterior thecal sac and may cause slight crowding
upon the descending right L4 nerve root in the right lateral recess.
Facet hypertrophy may mildly narrow the neural foramina.
 
L4-L5:  Disc bulge indents the ventral thecal sac.  There may be slight
crowding upon the descending L5 nerve roots in the lateral recesses.
Facet hypertrophy contributes to mild bilateral neural foraminal
stenosis.
 
L5-S1:  Disc bulge does not significantly indent the ventral thecal
sac.  There is asymmetric approximation of the anterior margin of the
descending right S1 nerve root without definite mass effect upon it.
Posterior osteophytic change and facet hypertrophy mildly narrow the
neural foramina.
 
The remainder of the visualized proximal exiting sacral nerve roots are
grossly unimpinged. The visualized visceral structures show no gross
abnormalities.
 
IMPRESSION:
New STIR hyperintensity in the superior L5 endplate.  It is uncertain
if this is degenerative/reactive (given question of small developing
Schmorl's nodes) or if it could be post-traumatic in etiology.  No loss
of vertebral body height however.
 
Otherwise, degenerative changes from L3-L4 through L5-S1 are similar.

INDICATION: 45-year-old F with given reason for exam of "hyponatremia,
rule out lung mass".
 
TECHNIQUE:  CT imaging obtained from apices through the lung bases
following intravenous administration of 100 ml Omnipaque-300 iodinated
contrast media.  Multiplanar 2-D reformations performed  Individualized
radiation dose reduction techniques were used.
 
COMPARISON:  Radiography 10/20/2016
 
FINDINGS:  Heart is normal in size.  No pleural or pericardial
effusion.  No mediastinal or hilar adenopathy evident.  Aorta appears
unremarkable.  Thyroid may be borderline in size.
 
In the upper abdomen, I see no adrenal mass.  Gallbladder surgically
absent.
 
The lungs are generally mostly well inflated.  There is a calcified
granuloma the right suprahilar region near the minor fissure on the
right as well.  No other more worrisome non-mineralized pulmonary
parenchymal nodularity is detected. Central airways in the chest appear
to remain patent.
 
Visible osseous structures reveal no acute or aggressive process.
There is mild to moderate multilevel osteophytosis and degenerative
disease in the mid thoracic spine.
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  No lung neoplasm or other suspicious mass detected.  Incidental
benign sequelae of old granulomatous exposure noted.

HISTORY: aphasia
 
TECHNIQUE: Nonenhanced axial images of the head were acquired.
 
COMPARISON: MRI brain 03/21/2018
 
FINDINGS: No acute intra-axial extra-axial hemorrhage.  There is a 2.3
cm hypodense extra-axial area within the right frontal lobe, which
probably represents volume averaging with the CSF.  A similar
appearance is seen on the CT exam 01/24/2018..  There is a 3.5 cm area
of hypodensity within the left posterior parietal lobe white matter
with effacement of the adjacent sulci.  This is consistent with
vasogenic edema and is similar to the prior MRI examination. There are
hypodense areas within both left and right cerebellum in a distribution
and configuration similar to the edema  seen on the MRI examination.
The contrast enhanced MRI examination demonstrated underlying
metastatic disease in these areas of vasogenic edema. There is no
hydrocephalus or midline shift.
Bone windows show no fractures, osteoblastic or osteolytic lesions.
 
There is mucosal thickening in the visualized left maxillary sinus.
 
IMPRESSION: There is  vasogenic edema in the left posterior parietal
lobe and in the left and right cerebellum consistent with known
underlying metastatic disease. No intracranial hemorrhage.
 
The findings were communicated to Dr. Mays by telephone on 23:32, who
expressed understanding.
 
While no definitive evidence for acute ischemia is apparent, acute
ischemic changes can be radiographically occult by CT scan and MRI with
diffusion weighted imaging can be performed if clinically indicated in
further evaluation.

EXAM: SCT ABD/PELVIS WO CONTRAST
 
HISTORY: abd pain, history of MRSA infection in aorta
 
TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast enhanced transaxial images of the abdomen and
pelvis were acquired from the lung bases to the symphysis pubis.
 
COMPARISON: 12/18/2017
 
FINDINGS: Exam is limited by lack of IV contrast.
 
The lung bases show stable appearance of probable atelectasis in the
right lung.
 
The liver, spleen, pancreas, gallbladder and adrenal glands are
unremarkable.
 
The bowel gas pattern is normal. The stomach, small bowel and large
bowel are unremarkable.
 
The kidneys are normal size.  No masses, calculus, or hydronephrosis is
present.
 
Again demonstrated in the upper abdomen in the left periaortic region
there is abnormal soft tissue density.  Evaluation of this area is very
limited due to lack of IV contrast.  The area measures about 4 cm and
is similar to the regional examination and November 10, 2017 of a of
increased in size since the more recent exam December 18, 2017. There
are small areas of calcification within the region which were not
present on the previous exam but could be due to fat necrosis and
calcification. There may be displacement of some of the calcifications
associated with the calcified aorta.
 
The appendix is not visualized.
 
The urinary bladder is unremarkable.
 
There is a right hip arthroplasty which produces significant artifacts
through the pelvis and limits evaluation of the pelvis. There is a
levoscoliosis of the lumbar spine with multilevel spondylosis similar
to prior exam.
 
Impression:
 
Examination limited by lack of IV contrast.  Persistent and perhaps
enlarging soft tissue density surrounding the proximal abdominal aorta
at the level of the renal hilum.  Some of the calcifications about the
aorta appeared to be displaced.  This is raises the possibility of a
underlying mycotic aneurysm or other pathology. Additional evaluation
with oral and contrast enhanced CT is recommended.
 
The findings were communicated to Dr. Hull by telephone on 01:57, who
expressed understanding.

COMPARISON:  April 14, 2018 12:29 a.m.
 
FINDINGS:  Minimal dependent atelectasis is seen bilaterally in the
lung bases.
 
There is a 19 x 29 mm saccular aneurysm of the proximal abdominal aorta
just below the level of the renal arteries.
Inflammatory changes are seen within the periaortic soft tissues.  No
abscess is seen within the soft tissues.  No evidence of rupture is
seen.  Multiple borderline enlarged left periaortic nodes are noted. No
bony erosions are noted.
 
The liver, spleen, pancreas and gallbladder unremarkable.  The kidneys
enhance symmetrically there is no evidence of hydronephrosis.  There is
no bowel obstruction.  No free fluid is seen in the abdomen or pelvis.
The bladder is unremarkable.  No acute bony changes are noted.
Degenerative changes lumbar spine are noted.  A right hip replacement
is noted.
 
IMPRESSION:
1. 1.9 x 2.9 cm saccular aneurysm of the abdominal aorta just below the
level of the renal arteries. This is highly suspicious for a mycotic
aneurysm.
2.  Borderline enlarged left periaortic nodes noted.
3.  Inflammatory changes noted about the aneurysm.  No evidence of
rupture seen.
4.  No free fluid.
5.  No bowel obstruction.

EXAM:  CT FACE WITH IV CONTRAST
 
INDICATION:  Facial swelling since Monday.
 
COMPARISON:  None
 
TECHNIQUE:  Routine CT imaging of the face was performed with IV
contrast.
 
FINDINGS:
In the tissues overlying the maxilla at the midline there is a
peripherally enhancing focus which extends superiorly into the nasal
region with involvement of the cartilaginous nasal septum and both
nares.  The collection is difficult to measure but it is at least 4.2 x
3.2 x 2.1 cm maximum dimension and there is adjacent extensive
inflammation.
 
The visualized intracranial compartment shows no abnormal enhancement.
No gross orbital abnormalities.  The right frontal sinus is completely
opacified.  Scattered paranasal sinus inflammatory changes are present
elsewhere.  The mastoid air cells are clear.  No gross orbital
abnormalities.  Osseous degenerative changes.  Postoperative changes of
anterior fusion in the cervical spine are incompletely imaged.
 
 
IMPRESSION:
Large peripherally enhancing focus anterior to the maxilla with
extension into the nasal region with involvement of the nasal septum
and both nares.  This probably represents an abscess but clinical
correlation to help exclude a necrotic mass is requested. Recommend
follow-up.

COMPARISON:MRI 11/04/2012
 
FINDINGS:  Third and lateral ventriculomegaly is again present, which
has slightly increased since brain MRI from 11/14/2012, allowing for
differences in technique to the degree of third and lateral
ventriculomegaly may be slightly greater than expected relative to the
degree of cortical volume loss, however, this appearance may simply
represent progressed central atrophy. Mild, nonspecific,
periventricular white matter hypoattenuation is present, which may be
related to chronic small vessel disease. The visible paranasal sinuses
and visible mastoid air cells are clear. A left frontal scalp hematoma
with associated soft tissue defect is present. No acute underlying
fracture is appreciated.  Minimal hyperdense fluid is present along the
left frontal - parietal - temporal convexity, compatible with acute
subdural hematoma.  There is some extension of hemorrhage into the
adjacent cerebral sulci along the left temporal parietal lobe,
compatible with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Additionally, a minimal amount
of probable acute subdural hemorrhage and associated subarachnoid
hemorrhage is present along the posterior right temporal lobe
convexity/sulci, best seen on axial image 17.
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  Left frontal scalp hematoma/soft tissue defect without acute
underlying fracture identified.  A very small amount of post traumatic,
acute subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage is present, bilaterally.  No
significant mass effect or midline shift is present.
2.  Grossly stable cortical volume loss.  Third and lateral
ventriculomegaly has slightly progressed when compared to brain MRI
from 2012, allowing for differences in technique.  While this may
simply represent progressed central atrophy, findings are present which
also raise the question of normal-pressure hydrocephalus, as above.
Correlate clinically.
 
These findings were discussed with Dr. Schaumberg of the emergency
department on 04/14/2018 at 05:40 p.m.
 
MRI is more sensitive than CT for the detection of acute to subacute
infarction.

EXAM:  SCT BRAIN OR HEAD WO CONTRAST
 
HISTORY:  HEADACHE
 
COMPARISON: No relevant prior exam
 
TECHNIQUE: Multiple noncontrast CT images of the head were obtained.
Individualized dose optimalization was used.
 
FINDINGS:
  There are regions of low attenuation in the perventricular white
matter that most likely represent chronic small vessel ischemic change
and age related atrophy.  This process and limitations of NONcontract
head CT makes evaluation of acute ischemia suboptimal.  Further imaging
can be performed as needed.
  No acute hemorrhage. Mild sinus disease. No acute fracture.
 
 
IMPRESSION:
No acute process.

EXAM:  MRI of the cervical spine without IV contrast
 
INDICATION:  Neck pain. Pain radiates in the right shoulder blade.
 
COMPARISON:  None available.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar MRI evaluation of the cervical spine was
performed without IV contrast.
 
FINDINGS:
 
Cervical spine alignment is normal.  The cervical spine vertebral
bodies are normal height.  Modic type 1 endplate changes are at C6-C7.
There may be minimal STIR hyperintensity in the right C4-C5 facet,
presumably degenerative/reactive.  Prevertebral soft tissues are
unremarkable.  No cervical cord signal abnormality.
 
C2-C3:  Disc bulge minimally indents the ventral thecal sac.  There is
facet hypertrophy, but the neural foramen are widely patent.
 
C3-C4:  Disc bulge indents the ventral thecal sac.  Uncovertebral and
facet hypertrophy may mildly narrow the neural foramina.
 
C4-C5:  Disc bulge indents the ventral thecal sac.  Uncovertebral and
facet hypertrophy mildly narrow the neural foramina.
 
C5-C6:  Disc bulge indents the ventral thecal sac.  Uncovertebral
hypertrophy may mildly narrow the neural foramina.
 
C6-C7:  Disc bulge flattens the ventral thecal sac.  The central canal
is narrowed to a maximum AP dimension of 8 mm.  Uncovertebral
hypertrophy causes mild - moderate bilateral neural foraminal stenosis.
 
C7-T1:  There is trace disc bulge and facet hypertrophy with perhaps
mild foraminal stenosis.  The central canal is widely patent.
 
Visualized unenhanced soft tissue structures of the neck show no
significant abnormalities.
 
IMPRESSION:
Multilevel degenerative changes.  Mild central stenosis is most
apparent C6-C7.  No cord signal abnormality.  Varying degrees of
foraminal stenosis are without impingement of any of the exiting nerve
roots.
 
Modic type 1 endplate change at C6-C7 and mild STIR hyperintensity in
the right C4-C5 facet, likely degenerative/reactive and perhaps a
source of pain.

EXAM:  MRI of the cervical spine without IV contrast
 
INDICATION:  Neck pain with radiculopathy. History of lung cancer.
 
COMPARISON:  Neck CT dated 12/26/2017.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar MRI evaluation of the cervical spine was
performed without IV contrast.
 
FINDINGS:
 
Cervical spine alignment is normal.  The cervical spine vertebral
bodies are normal height.  There is T1 hyperintense marrow signal which
could be due to radiation therapy.  Prevertebral soft tissues are
unremarkable.  No cervical cord signal abnormality is corroborated in
both imaging planes.  Incidental note made of posterior fossa arachnoid
cyst.
 
C2-C3:  The central canal and neural foramen are widely patent but
there is mild facet hypertrophy.
 
C3-C4:  A central protrusion indents the ventral thecal sac.
Uncovertebral hypertrophy may mildly narrow the neural foramina
especially on the left.
 
C4-C5:  Disc bulge minimally indents the ventral thecal sac.
Uncovertebral and facet hypertrophy cause mild left neural foraminal
stenosis.  The right neural foramen is patent.
 
C5-C6:  Disc bulge indents the ventral thecal sac.  Uncovertebral and
facet hypertrophy cause mild - moderate left and mild right neural
foraminal stenosis.
 
C6-C7:  Disc bulge minimally indents the ventral thecal sac.
Uncovertebral hypertrophy mildly narrows the neural foramina.
 
C7-T1:  The central canal and neural foramen are widely patent.
 
The visualized unenhanced soft tissue structures of the neck show
similar size of a lymph node just deep to the tail of the right parotid
gland.  This is calcified on the reference CT.
 
IMPRESSION:
Mild degenerative changes.  No greater than mild central canal
narrowing, no cord signal abnormality.  No definite exiting nerve root
impingement.

EXAMINATION:  CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST,  04/14/2018
 
INDICATION: 77-year-old M with given reason for exam of "left lower
quadrant pain, diarrhea".
 
TECHNIQUE:  CT imaging obtained from lung bases through symphysis pubis
following intravenous administration of 75 ml Visipaque 270 iodinated
contrast media.  Multiplanar 2-D reformations performed.
Individualized radiation dose reduction techniques were used.
 
COMPARISON:  No relevant recent prior study available.
 
FINDINGS:  The visible lowermost chest reveals a normal-sized heart.
There is evidence of previous median sternotomy.  Extreme visible lung
bases appear generally mostly clear.  Mild subpleural discoid
atelectasis or scarring noted at the bases. Some pleural thickening and
perhaps trace fluid left lower chest pleural space. No drainable
collection.
 
In the abdomen, the liver size appears normal.  The spleen, pancreas
appear generally unremarkable.  There is no adrenal mass.  Kidneys
appear somewhat atrophic with multiple bilateral benign-appearing renal
cysts vary in size from sub-centimeter up to the largest, currently on
the right at 6.1 cm in size.  There is abdominal aortic calcific
atherosclerosis but no AAA.  I see no upper abdominal, retroperitoneal
or mesenteric adenopathy.  Gallbladder appears unremarkable.
 
Visible GI tract reveals no obstruction or acute inflammatory change in
the upper abdomen.  There is moderate diverticulosis descending colon.
 
In the pelvis, there is inflammation along the mesenteric margin of the
colon.  Given surrounding diverticulosis, this may be sequelae of focal
diverticulitis.  Complications of colon cancer can present in similar
fashion and follow-up lower endoscopy recommended after resolution of
the acute inflammatory process.  No acute drainable abscess noted.  No
free intraperitoneal perforation detected.
 
Prostate remains in place.  Vas deferens show some mineralization.
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  Acute inflammation proximal sigmoid colon margin.  Consider acute
diverticulitis without abscess, though complications of colon cancer
can present in similar fashion, and follow-up lower endoscopy
recommended after resolution of the acute inflammatory process.
2.  Somewhat atrophic kidneys with uremic cystic disease.
3.  Not described above, small hypoattenuating lesion noted lateral
segment left hepatic lobe, reference axial series 2 image 12, partially
7 mm in size.  Another lesion noted send segment image number 19.
These are too small to characterize and could be simply cysts are other
biliary hamartoma benign lesions.  Midline, that is difficult to
completely exclude.  There is also a third lesion medial aspect
inferior right hepatic lobe on image number 28.  Also
incidental benign mineralization posterior right hepatic lobe. Further
characterization of the liver might be prudent.  Consider dedicated
hepatic MRI (with/without MultiHance contrast) and/or other imaging
follow-up over time.

Circle of Willis MRA without contrast
 
INDICATION(S):  Syncope.  History of aneurysm.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Axial 3-D time-of-flight MR angiography of the circle of
Willis was performed without contrast.  Sagittal T2-weighted images of
the brain were also acquired.
 
Comparison:  MRA dated 03/16/2017.
 
Findings:
 
In the anterior circulation, the intracranial internal carotid arteries
are widely patent.  There is some susceptibility artifact in the region
of the right posterior communicating artery presumably reflecting
endovascular coil material without definite evidence of recurrent or
residual aneurysm.  There also is some susceptibility artifact in the
left paraclinoid region probably due to pipeline embolization device
without definite recurrent or residual aneurysm.
 
Both anterior and middle cerebral arteries are widely patent.
 
In the posterior circulation, the distal V4 segments are patent.  The
basilar artery is patent.  Fetal left PCA.  Both posterior cerebral
arteries are patent.
 
Impression:
 
Postprocedural changes status post treatment of bilateral anterior
circulation aneurysms.  Imaging appearance is similar compared to
prior.  No definite recurrent or residual aneurysm.  If there is
continued clinical concern for this consider conventional angiography.

EXAM: SCT THORAX W CONTRAST FOR PE
 
HISTORY: Elevated D-Dimer, Resp distress
 
TECHNIQUE: Following IV injection of contrast, multislice helical CT of
the chest was obtained from the thoracic inlet to the upper abdomen.
Images were reformmatted into the axial, sagittal and coronal planes.
 
CONTRAST: 75cc Visipaque 270 IV
 
COMPARISON: CT chest without contrast 03/14/2018
 
FINDINGS:
 
The thoracic inlet is normal.
 
There is increased number of small lymph nodes in the mediastinum.
Some of these lymph nodes have increased slightly in size since the
previous examination.  In the aorticopulmonary window there is a 11 mm
lymph node.  These may be reactive.  There is mild right hilar
lymphadenopathy measuring up to 11 mm. This is also slightly increased
in size compared to the previous exam and may also be reactive.
 
There is atherosclerotic calcification within the thoracic aorta and
great vessels. The pulmonary vasculature is normal, with no filling
defects in the pulmonary arteries.
 
 There has been a significant change in the appearance of the lungs.
Increasing ground-glass opacities are present in the right upper lobe
as well as to the right lower lobe and to a lesser degree the right
middle lobe. There are also small patchy areas of ground-glass
opacities in the anterior left upper lobe which is new. Both lung
fields demonstrate diffuse increase in interstitial thickening as well
as peribronchial thickening. There are new small bilateral pleural
effusions, right greater than left.
 
There is unchanged left atrial enlargement. There is no pericardial
effusion.
Mild bilateral gynecomastia is present. Small area of sclerosis at T10
is unchanged and may represent a bone island.
Limited examination of the upper demonstrates a 3.2 cm infrarenal
abdominal aortic aneurysm which is only partially imaged.
 
IMPRESSION:
 
1.  No pulmonary embolism evident.
2.  Worsened appearance of the lungs.  There has been progressive
increasing ground-glass opacities in the right lung and new small areas
of ground-glass opacities in the left lung. There has been development
of interstitial thickening in both lungs, right greater than left as
well as peribronchial thickening. Small bilateral pleural effusions,
right greater than left are also new. Findings may represent
interstitial pneumonitis.
3. Increase in size of mediastinal and right hilar lymph nodes
nonspecific but may be reactive.

EXAM:  MRI of the lumbar spine without IV contrast
 
INDICATION:  Low back pain.  Hip pain.
 
COMPARISON:  None available.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar MRI evaluation was performed without IV
contrast.
 
FINDINGS:
 
This report assumes that there are five lumbar vertebral bodies.
Lumbar spine alignment is normal.  The lumbar vertebral bodies are of
normal height.  There is mild STIR hyperintensity in the L4-L5 facets
which is presumably degenerative/reactive.  Several intervertebral
discs are desiccated.  The conus terminates at L1.
 
T12-L1:  Disc bulge indents the ventral thecal sac.  The neural foramen
are widely patent.
 
L1-L2:  The central canal and neural foramen are widely patent.
 
L2-L3:  The central canal and neural foramen are widely patent.
 
L3-L4:  The central canal and neural foramen are widely patent.
 
L4-L5:  Disc bulge minimally indents the ventral thecal sac.  Facet
hypertrophy may mildly narrow the neural foramina.
 
L5-S1:  The central canal is widely patent.  Small foraminal
protrusions and facet hypertrophy mildly narrow the neural foramina.
 
The visualized proximal exiting sacral nerve roots are grossly
unimpinged.  Small left renal cyst.
 
IMPRESSION:
Degenerative changes, greatest at T12-L1 and L5-S1.  No significant
central canal narrowing.  No focal nerve root impingement.
 
Mild STIR hyperintensity in the L4-L5 facets is presumably
degenerative/reactive and could be a source of pain.

Admitting DX: M47.816-Spondylosis w/o myelopathy or radiculopathy, lumbar region
Working DX: M47.816-Spondylosis w/o myelopathy or radiculopathy, lumbar region
 

EXAM:  MRI of the thoracic spine without IV contrast
 
INDICATION:  Spondylosis with radiculopathy.  Patient reports mid/low
back pain.
 
COMPARISON:  Thoracic CT dated 01/31/2017.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar MRI examination of the thoracic spine was
performed without IV contrast.
 
FINDINGS:
 
The study is degraded by motion.
 
Thoracic spine alignment is normal.  The thoracic spine vertebral
bodies are normal height and signal intensity.  Intervertebral discs
are well maintained.  No definite thoracic cord signal abnormality is
corroborated in both imaging planes.
 
Large field of view counting images show incompletely imaged
degenerative changes in the cervical spine.  At C6-C7 a left
paracentral protrusion asymmetrically indents the left anterior thecal
sac and at least moderately narrows the left neural foramen.
 
In the thoracic spine no greater than trace disc bulge indents the
ventral thecal sac in any location.  The thoracic neural foramen are
grossly patent.
 
The visualized visceral structures show no gross abnormalities.
 
IMPRESSION:
Only minimal degenerative change in the thoracic spine.  No significant
central canal narrowing, cord signal abnormality, or focal nerve root
impingement.
 
Incompletely imaged lower cervical degenerative changes.  If clinically
indicated consider a dedicated cervical spine MRI to further evaluate.

Working DX: M47.816-Spondylosis w/o myelopathy or radiculopathy, lumbar region
 

EXAM:  MRI of the lumbar spine without IV contrast
 
INDICATION:  Spondylosis and radiculopathy.  Low back pain.
 
COMPARISON:  Lumbar CT dated 01/31/2017.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar MRI evaluation was performed without IV
contrast.
 
FINDINGS:
 
This report uses this same nomenclature of the prior exam assuming five
lumbar vertebral bodies. There is partial lumbarization of S1.  There
is 12 mm anterolisthesis of L5 on S1.  Bilateral L5 pars defects.  The
lumbar vertebral bodies are normal height with scattered Schmorl's
nodes.  Mild modic type 1 endplate changes are L5-S1.  Several
intervertebral discs are desiccated and the L5-S1 disc is narrowed.
The conus terminates at L2.
 
T12-L1:  Disc bulge minimally indents the ventral thecal sac.  The
neural foramen are widely patent.
 
L1-L2:  Disc bulge with a central protrusion indents the ventral thecal
sac.  The neural foramen are widely patent.
 
L2-L3:  Disc bulge minimally indents the ventral thecal sac.  The
neural foramen are widely patent.
 
L3-L4:  Trace disc bulge minimally indents the ventral thecal sac.  The
neural foramen are widely patent.
 
L4-L5:  Facet hypertrophy may mildly narrow the neural foramina
especially on the right.  The central canal is widely patent.
 
L5-S1:  Disc bulge/signal bulge indents and flattens the ventral thecal
sac.  Disc material along with spondylolisthesis and facet hypertrophy
severely narrow the neural foramina with likely impingement of both
exiting L5 nerve roots.
 
The visualized proximal exiting sacral nerve roots are grossly
unimpinged otherwise.
 
The visualized visceral structures show no gross abnormalities.
 
IMPRESSION:
 
This report uses this same nomenclature of the prior exam assuming five
lumbar vertebral bodies. There is partial lumbarization of S1.
 
Degenerative changes, greatest at L5-S1 where there is severe bilateral
neural foraminal stenosis and likely impingement of the exiting L5
nerve roots secondary to degenerative disc disease, facet hypertrophy,
spondylolisthesis, and bilateral L5 pars defects.  Please correlate for
bilateral L5 radiculopathies.

EXAM: SCT ABD/PELVIS WO CONTRAST
 
HISTORY: RECENT MID ABDOMEN HERNIA SURGERY AND NOW HAVING DRAINAGE
 
TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast enhanced transaxial images of the abdomen and
pelvis were acquired from the lung bases to the symphysis pubis.
 
COMPARISON: None
 
FINDINGS: Exam is limited by lack of IV contrast.
 
There is a 4 mm pulmonary nodule in the lingula.  Several small sub
centimeter pulmonary nodules are present in the right lower lobe and
along the right major fissure. There are a few partially imaged sub
centimeter subpleural nodules in the right middle lobe.
 
The liver appears small with nodular contour suggestive of cirrhotic
morphology. Surgical clips in the gallbladder fossa from prior
cholecystectomy.  Spleen is unremarkable.  Pancreas normal. The adrenal
glands normal. Kidneys demonstrate no obstructive changes or renal
calculus.
 
The bowel gas pattern is normal. The stomach, small bowel and large
bowel are unremarkable.
 
Postoperative changes of anterior ventral wall hernia repair with
multiple surgical clips along the anterior abdominal wall.  There is a
soft tissue defect in the mid abdomen. At the level of the soft tissue
defect there may be a small amount of fluid. There is mild induration
of the mesentery deep to the anterior abdominal wall repair which is
likely postsurgical in nature. No intra-abdominal abscess. There is
induration of the subcutaneous fat anterior to the anterior abdominal
wall. There is a small amount of subcutaneous air along the levels of
the hernia repair. Induration of the subcutaneous fat along the lateral
aspect of the abdomen may represent edema.
 
The appendix is visualized and has a normal appearance.
 
The urinary bladder is unremarkable. There is a small amount of fluid
in the pelvis, which may be postsurgical.
 
The prostate gland and seminal vesicles are unremarkable.
 
The abdominal aorta demonstrates atherosclerotic calcification without
aneurysm.
 
No suspicious osseous lesions are identified. There is a
rotodextroscoliosis of the lumbar spine with advanced multilevel
spondylosis.
 
IMPRESSION:
 
1. Nonspecific multiple  sub centimeter nodules and subpleural nodules
in the lower lungs. Clinical correlation is recommended.  Consider
dedicated CT of the chest or comparison with outside studies if
available, if indicated.
 
2. Postoperative changes of anterior abdominal wall hernia repair.
Soft tissue defect along the midline anterior abdomen with probably a
small amount of fluid at the level of the defect.  Induration and
subcutaneous air along the anterior abdominal wall is likely
postsurgical in nature.  There is no intra-abdominal abscess.
 
3. Cirrhotic morphology of the liver.
 
4. Small amount of fluid in the pelvis may be postsurgical in nature.

Working DX: PNEUMONIA, ASTHMA
 

EXAMINATION:  CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST,  04/14/2018
 
INDICATION: 75-year-old M with given reason for exam of "tachycardia,
SOB".
 
TECHNIQUE:  CT imaging obtained from apices through the lung bases
following intravenous administration 75 ml Visipaque 320 iodinated
contrast media.  Multiplanar 2-D reformations performed.
Individualized radiation dose reduction techniques were used.
 
COMPARISON:  Chest radiography earlier same date
 
FINDINGS:  The pulmonary arteries appear generally well opacified, with
no filling defect evident in a pattern to suggest acute pulmonary
thromboembolism.  Thoracic aorta appears intact.  There is mild
thoracic aortic atherosclerosis.  There is abundant coronary calcific
atherosclerosis, technique not optimized for detailed evaluation of the
coronary tree.  There is no mediastinal or hilar adenopathy.  No
pleural or pericardial effusion.
 
In the upper abdomen, no adrenal mass noted.
 
Visible osseous structures reveal chronic degenerative changes in the
thoracic spine.  No acute or aggressive appearing osseous process
detected.
 
Lungs reveal patchy mixed interstitial/alveolar infiltrate in the lower
lung zones with some bronchial wall thickening and some left lower lobe
bronchial occlusion centrally, perhaps mucous plugging.  Paraseptal
emphysematous change noted upper lobe predominance.  No pneumothorax or
pleural effusion seen.  No discrete lung mass evident.
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  No acute PE.
2.  Subtle interstitial and minimal alveolar infiltrates in the lung
bases with some bronchial wall thickening and bronchial plugging as
described.  Suspect atypical pneumonia, cannot exclude aspiration
etiology given distribution.
3.  No pleural effusion.
4.  Coronary calcific atherosclerosis.
